# Real-Time Financial Advisor LLM System

## Overview
The **Real-Time Financial Advisor LLM System** is an open-source AI-powered Q&A system built using GPT-3.5. It provides real-time answers and insights to financial queries, assisting investors, financial analysts, and enthusiasts with on-the-spot analysis and recommendations based on live data.

## Technology Stack
The system is built using:
- **GPT-3.5** for natural language processing and financial query answering.
- **Comet ML** for tracking experiments and fine-tuning the model.
- **ByteWax** for streaming live financial data.
- **LangChain** for developing natural language processing pipelines.
- **Vector Databases** for efficient data retrieval and analysis.

## System Architecture
The system integrates a three-pipeline architecture for real-time financial data processing:

### 1. Feature Pipeline
- Collects real-time financial news using **Alpaca API**.
- Stores historical financial datasets for analysis.
- Provides both streaming and structured financial news data.

### 2. Training Pipeline
- Uses **QLora** for training a Large Language Model (LLM) with financial data.
- Includes a **Q&A dataset** tailored for financial analysis.
- Fine-tunes the model to enhance accuracy and relevancy.

### 3. Inference Pipeline
- Exposes a **RESTful API** for external integrations.
- Features a **Financial Assistance Bot** to process user queries.
- Includes a **UI for interaction** with the financial advisory system.
