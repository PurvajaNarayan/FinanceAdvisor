This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. </p>\n<p>Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the <strong>48.31</strong> in the Personal Products industry, BellRing Brands Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of <strong>40.67</strong>. Shareholders might be inclined to think that  the stock might perform worse than it's industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued. </p>\n<p><p><img src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2025/1735740007_1.png\" alt=\"Guage\" /></p></p>\n<p>In conclusion, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric for analyzing a company's market performance, but it has its limitations. While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued, it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth. Additionally, the P/E ratio should not be used in isolation, as other factors such as industry trends and business cycles can also impact a company's stock price. Therefore, investors should use the P/E ratio in conjunction with other financial metrics and qualitative analysis to make informed investment decisions. </p>"

taking the crown for the month of December. The stock is regularly one of the most-searched tickers on the site each month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super Micro Computer climbed up the leaderboard for the month, ranking second in December. The surge in interest came with shares down significantly in the month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia ranked third for the month of December, its lowest ranking in several months of tracking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several companies made their first appearance on the list of most-searched tickers with the<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/movers/24/12/42380768/quantum-computing-stocks-roundup-d-wave-rigetti-ionq-lead-the-charge-with-explosive-growth\"> theme of quantum computing </a>stocks showing through in the monthly rankings. Quantum Computing, Rigetti and D-Wave Quantum all ranked among the top 20 searched tickers for the month of December.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other newcomers to the top 10 included SoundHound AI, a popular AI play and short squeeze candidate. The stock has been highlighted several times in the<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/24/12/42628286/benzingas-stock-whisper-index-5-stocks-investors-secretly-monitor-but-dont-talk-about-yet-including-qubt-qbts\"> Benzinga Stock Whisper Index</a> and company executives have been interviewed by <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/tech/24/12/42628373/exclusive-soundhound-ai-ceo-on-882-growth-were-just-getting-started\">Benzinga recently.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>MicroStrategy, who is one of the largest holders of <strong>Bitcoin </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/btc/usd\">BTC</a>) ranked ninth in the list, gaining from a 16<sup>th</sup> place ranking in September. The stock continues to be a proxy for Bitcoin, but with the rise of Bitcoin ETFs will be an interesting case study to watch in 2025 for investor appetite with more ways for investors to get exposure to the leading cryptocurrency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nukkleus was another newcomer to the top 10 and will be worth watching to see if this is a one-month inclusion or start of investor momentum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the ETF front, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust ranked fourth for the month and continues to be one of the most-watched ETFs. The Invesco QQQ Trust ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 fell to 20<sup>th</sup> for the month after ranking 15<sup>th</sup> in October and sixth in September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Trump Media &amp; Technology Group</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/DJT#NASDAQ\">DJT</a>), which ranked third in October, fell out of the top 20 stocks. This could show that the stock gained momentum around the 2024 election and the move may have been short-lived. With President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration in January, it will be worth monitoring to see if the stock gains in price and interest among Benzinga readers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple Inc </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\">AAPL</a>) was one of the bigger surprises in December. The stock is regularly ranked among the top 10 most-searched tickers and ranked eighth in October. The stock fell out of the top 20, ranking 25<sup>th</sup> in December.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall the month of December saw four of the same top 10 tickers from October and eight of the top 20 tickers from October.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/politics/24/10/41584466/these-10-stocks-were-the-best-s-p-500-performers-in-2017-when-trump-was-president-will-history-r\">These 10 Stocks Were The Best S&amp;P 500 Performers In 2017 When Trump Was President: Will History Repeat Itself?</a></strong></li>\n</ul>    "

The last launch of the year was conducted on Tuesday when the company&#8217;s Falcon 9 launched 21 Starlink satellites to low-Earth orbit from Florida.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company also completed four test flights of its ambitious Starship launch vehicle this year &#8211; in March, June, October, and the latest in November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Landmark Missions:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In September, SpaceX launched the Polaris Dawn mission to space. The five-day Polaris Dawn mission included a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40830436/spacex-completes-1st-ever-spacewalk-by-a-commercial-company-as-part-of-polaris-dawn-mission\">spacewalk carried out by private astronauts</a> including billionaire and Shift4 Payments CEO&nbsp;<strong>Jared Isaacman</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While space agency NASA routinely conducts extravehicular activities with government astronauts, no commercial player or civilians attempted it before, making Polaris a landmark mission for SpaceX and commercial spaceflight companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet another significant achievement for the company this year was when it <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/space/24/11/42105704/spacex-ceo-elon-musk-reveals-technical-glitch-that-led-company-to-drop-key-objective-of-starships-6th-test-flight\">caught the Starship launch vehicle&#8217;s booster back at Starbase </a>with the metal arms of the launch tower, in a demonstration of the vehicle&#8217;s reusability, during its third flight test in October.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Accidents And Operational Pauses:</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The year, however, was not without accidents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SpaceX launched its Falcon 9 rocket with 20 Starlink satellites from California on July 11. However, the Starlink satellites were deployed in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/07/39766325/starlink-satellites-from-thursdays-launch-will-fully-demise-in-earths-atmosphere-says-elon-musks-spa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lower-than-intended orbit&nbsp;</a>owing to an issue with the rocket&#8217;s second-stage engine. The Starlink satellites were demised and the company's launch operations were subsequently <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/41088324/spacexs-falcon-9-rocket-grounded-3rd-time-in-3-months-launch-put-on-hold-as-company-hunts-for-root-c\">placed on hold </a>until July 27.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In late August, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded the Falcon after a rocket booster that supported a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/starlink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Starlink mission</a>&nbsp;failed to land upright on a droneship at sea and exploded upon returning to Earth. However, the FAA gave the green light for the company to resume launch operations two days later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this month, Reuters also reported that SpaceX lost ground control for at least an hour during the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40787779/spacex-launches-polaris-dawn-crew-to-space-with-aim-of-first-ever-private-spacewalk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Polaris Dawn mission</a>&nbsp;in September. The SpaceX mission control was unable to command its Dragon spacecraft in orbit during the outage but the vehicle remained safe and maintained some communication with the ground with the help of the company's Starlink satellite network, the report said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reuters could not determine the exact time and duration of the outage. However, as per two of the agency's sources, it <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/regulations/24/12/42546578/spacex-lost-ground-control-on-dragon-spacecraft-during-polaris-dawn-mission-due-to-power-outage-at-california-facility-report\">happened before the planned spacewalk</a> and lasted at least an hour.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Check out more of Benzinga's Future Of Mobility coverage by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/mobility\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">following this link.</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/tech/24/12/42666472/gms-60000-cadillac-lyriq-was-its-best-selling-ev-in-2024-as-of-q3-is-premium-the-way-to-go-for-ev-makers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">GM's $60,000 Cadillac Lyriq Was Its Best Selling EV In 2024 As Of Q3: Is Premium The Way To Go For EV Makers?</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo courtesy: Shutterstock</em></p>"

        "summary": "In a significant development, the gas transit from Russia to Europe via Ukraine has been terminated after operating for five decades.",
        "content": "<p>In a significant development, the gas transit from Russia to Europe via Ukraine has been terminated after operating for five decades. This move comes as Ukraine declines to support any transit that contributes to Moscow&#8217;s war efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: Both Russia and Ukraine announced the cessation of gas flow on Wednesday. This follows the expiration of a crucial transit deal. The halt will compel central European countries, which have depended on these flows, to seek more costly gas alternatives. This will further strain supplies as the region&#8217;s winter storage rapidly depletes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The transit route accounted for a small 5% of Europe&#8217;s gas needs. However, its closure comes at a time when countries are still grappling with an energy crisis sparked by Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine. Gas prices have seen a 50% surge year-on-year, and the impending supply cutoff has further escalated these prices, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-01/russia-and-ukraine-end-five-decades-of-gas-transit-to-europe?srnd=homepage-americas&amp;sref=TBDibEcD\">reports </a>Bloomberg. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stoppage in gas transit will result in a loss of approximately $6 billion a year in revenue for Russia, according to Bloomberg&#8217;s estimates. Ukraine will also suffer a loss in transit fees and will lose its strategic position as a provider&nbsp;of affordable energy for Western&nbsp;allies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Central European customers of Russia&#8217;s\u00a0<strong>Gazprom PJSC</strong>\u00a0(MCX: GAZP) have managed to secure alternative supplies, albeit at a higher cost. Slovakia&#8217;s largest gas utility,\u00a0<strong>Slovensky Plynarensky Priemysel AS</strong>, will shell out an additional \u20ac90 million ($93 million) annually to ensure\u00a0stable imports through different routes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/global/24/12/42743937/natural-gas-prices-spike-as-bone-chilling-arctic-blast-approaches\">Natural Gas Prices Spike As &#8216;Bone-Chilling&#8217; Arctic Blast Approaches</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On New Year&#8217;s Day, Gazprom halted supplies\u00a0after the five-year transit deal\u00a0expired. The company cited a lack of &#8220;technical and legal opportunities&#8221; for shipments amid Ukraine&#8217;s &#8220;repeated and explicit refusal&#8221; to extend these agreements. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was confirmed by Ukraine&#8217;s Energy Ministry, which stated that\u00a0Russian flows across its territory\u00a0ceased as of 7 a.m.\u00a0local time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The termination of gas transit from Russia to Europe via Ukraine marks a significant shift in the energy landscape. It underscores the geopolitical tensions and their impact on the global energy market. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This development is likely to exacerbate the ongoing energy crisis in Europe, further escalating gas prices and straining supplies. It also highlights the economic implications for both Russia and Ukraine, with significant revenue losses anticipated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, it underscores the strategic importance of Ukraine as a provider\u00a0of affordable energy for Western\u00a0allies, a position it now stands to lose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read Next</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/24/11/42113449/natural-gas-prices-spike-to-over-1-year-highs-oil-surges-to-70-as-russia-fires-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-to-ukraine\">Natural Gas Prices Spike To Over 1-Year Highs, Oil Surges To $70 As Ukraine Says Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Fired By Russia</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This content was partially produced with the help of\u00a0</em><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/author/benzinga-neuro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Benzinga Neuro</em></a><em>\u00a0and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.</em></p>"

above the industry average.

However, the high P/B and P/S ratios indicate that the market values the company's assets and sales more highly. On the other hand, the high ROE and revenue growth, along with low EBITDA and gross profit, suggest that NVIDIA is generating strong returns on equity and experiencing rapid revenue growth, despite lower operational earnings and gross profit margins.</p>\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.</em></p>"

A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily.

The low ROE suggests lower profitability relative to its high EBITDA and gross profit margins. Additionally, the high revenue growth rate may be driving the high valuation multiples for Amazon.com within the industry sector.</p>\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.</em></p>"

A low P/E ratio can be an indication of undervaluation, but it can also suggest weak growth prospects or financial instability. Moreover, the P/E ratio is just one of many metrics that investors should consider when making investment decisions, and it should be evaluated alongside other financial ratios, industry trends, and qualitative factors. By taking a comprehensive approach to analyzing a company's financial health, investors can make well-informed decisions that are more likely to lead to successful outcomes. </p>"

        "content": "<p>Venture capitalist <strong>Chamath Palihapitiya</strong> has questioned the long-standing advice of <strong>Warren Buffett</strong> to invest in low-fee S&amp;P 500 index funds. Palihapitiya warns of potential risks due to the index&#8217;s heavy concentration in a few tech stocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: Buffett has consistently recommended that the average person invest in a low-fee S&amp;P\u00a0500 index fund and hold\u00a0it for the long term.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Palihapitiya, co-host of the &#8220;All-In&#8221; podcast, contends that a handful of tech\u00a0stocks have become so valuable\u00a0that owning the S&amp;P 500 is essentially a concentrated bet on these risky businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Palihapitiya&#8217;s concern is that the top 10 most valuable S&amp;P 500 companies, including&nbsp;<strong>Apple Inc.</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\">AAPL</a>),&nbsp;<strong>Nvidia Corporation</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NVDA#NASDAQ\">NVDA</a>), and&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft Corporation</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ\">MSFT</a>), account for nearly 40%&nbsp;of the benchmark index&#8217;s total&nbsp;market cap. This, he argues, contradicts the diversification principle that underpins index investing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When\u00a0you buy an index of\u00a0500 companies, you&#8217;re really buying\u00a010 companies with 490 others\u00a0thrown in,&#8221; Palihapitiya said in the X post on Saturday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/12/42638957/warren-buffetts-timeless-advice-if-youre-gonna-do-dumb-things-because-your-stock-goes-down-you-shouldnt-own-a-stock-at-all\">Warren Buffett&#8217;s Timeless Advice For Investing $10,000: &#8216;If You&#8217;re Gonna Do Dumb Things Because Your Stock Goes Down, You Shouldn&#8217;t Own A Stock At All&#8217;</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Average Americans buy S&amp;P 500 index ETFs, in part, because Buffett told them to.

This move comes despite the Biden administration&#8217;s efforts to obstruct the agreements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: The unanimous verdict was announced on Monday, dealing a blow to Defense Secretary <strong>Lloyd Austin</strong>, The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/12/31/pentagon-911-plea-deals-khalid-sheikh-mohammed/\">Washington Post</a> reported. Austin intervened in the cases in August after a judge he assigned approved the agreements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The court determined that Austin, while having the authority to stop Judge <strong>Susan K. Escallier</strong> from making\u00a0future pretrial agreements on behalf\u00a0of the U.S. government, could not retroactively cancel them, the Post report said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The accused, including the alleged 9/11 mastermind <strong>Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</strong>, have already confessed their guilt, which weakens any additional proceedings against them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pentagon was assessing the decision on Tuesday, as per a senior U.S. defense official who wished to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the matter, the Post report said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The department did not initially react\u00a0to the ruling.

This development could potentially influence the course of future terrorism-related cases, particularly those involving pretrial agreements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the ruling underscores the limitations of executive power in influencing judicial decisions, even in matters of national security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40090667/911-mastermind-khalid-sheikh-mohammed-and-co-conspirators-reach-plea-deals-to-evade-death-penalty\"><strong>9/11 Mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed And Co-Conspirators Reach Plea Deals To Evade Death Penalty</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image via The U.S. National Archives</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.</em></p>"

Dow has hit a record eight 1,000-point milestones and the &#8220;Magnificent 7&#8221; stocks have driven a 30% surge in the Nasdaq Composite index.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what are the significant factors that will be shaping 2025? Here&#8217;s what analysts and industry players are forecasting.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Earnings Projections And Analyst Targets</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Analysts are predicting a strong year for the market in 2025, driven by robust earnings growth and a favorable economic environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Louis Navellier</strong>, chief investment officer at Navellier &amp; Associates, anticipates continued momentum, with earnings projected to \"reaccelerate from 8.4% on the S&amp;P 500 in Q3 to an estimated 12% in Q4. Q1 and Q2 also look strong and will be up over 10%.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yogesh Kansal</strong>, co-founder and chief business officer at Appreciate, identified a \"trinity of market forces\" that will propel the market: 14% corporate profit growth, pro-growth policies under the incoming Trump administration, and the continued AI boom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analysts are also bullish on the S&amp;P 500, with a median 2025 price target of 6,600, representing an 11% increase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, <strong>Julia Khandoshko</strong>, CEO of the broker Mind Money, cautioned that the index may not sustain its previous growth rate. \"Next year is likely to be a time for strong investment ideas, especially in small and medium-cap segments,\" she said. \"Overall market growth is quite possible, but a 20% increase in the S&amp;P 500 looks unlikely.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>High Valuations Raise Concerns?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some analysts are expressing concerns about high valuations in the U.S. equity market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mario Georgiou</strong>, executive director and head of investments at InCred Global Wealth, noted that &#8220;optimistic analyst targets, stretched positioning and high valuations leave the market vulnerable to larger pullbacks in our view, should we see any of the rosy projections falling short of lofty expectations.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think all investors agree that valuations are high and fully priced (Trailing P/E of 24+), leaving little room for positive equity returns to come from multiple expansions.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Kansal attributed high valuations to improved corporate profitability. &#8220;Stock valuations are at their highest levels in more than three years, leaving greater potential for turbulence,&#8221; Kansal said. &#8220;However, the valuations have gone up because corporate America's profitability has greatly improved, with more than a third of companies posting margins of above 60%.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/12/42678368/sp-500-hits-57-all-time-highs-in-record-breaking-2024-magnificent-7-drive-30-of-nasdaqs-surge\">S&amp;P 500 Hits 57 All-Time Highs In Record-Breaking 2024: Magnificent 7 Drive 30% Of Nasdaq&#8217;s Surge</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fed&#8217;s Stance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Federal Reserve&#8217;s recent shift in monetary policy has sparked debate among analysts. While the Fed&#8217;s dot plot projects two more 25-basis-point cuts in the next year, falling short of market expectations, Navellier predicts four cuts. &#8220;The Fed can only look so far,&#8221; Navellier said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As soon as the ECB cuts key interest rates\u2026 Treasury yields will fall and allow the Fed to cut another two times in late 2025.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Khandoshko emphasized the importance of trusting the regulator&#8217;s actions, acknowledging a less aggressive rate-cut path compared to previous expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Georgiou anticipates a different scenario. &#8220;We see fed funds rate staying above 4%, with longer end rates rising further\u2026 mainly due to rising inflation driven by the effects of President-elect <strong>Donald Trump</strong>'s policies.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He warned of the risk of &#8220;sticky inflation&#8221; and a repeat of the 1970s, potentially forcing the Fed to halt or even reverse rate cuts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kansal believes the shift could have a stabilizing effect on the market. &#8220;While there may be some short-term volatility\u2026 the longer-term effect could be a more stable market with a continued focus on earnings growth and sector performance rather than reliance on monetary easing.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Top Sectors To Watch In 2025</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While artificial intelligence and big tech-dominated 2024, analysts are looking to other sectors for potential gains in the coming year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Georgiou favors energy, citing &#8220;Undemanding valuations, shareholder friendliness (buybacks and dividend yields).&#8221; He added that the sector would be &#8220;most immune to tariffs given low imports subject to tariffs.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Khandoshko emphasized the importance of pharmaceuticals and artificial intelligence, stating, &#8220;The market is likely to become a platform for major trends, where success will depend on the choice of industries rather than individual stocks.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kansal highlighted financials, materials, and consumer cyclicals. &#8220;Financials due to reduced regulation and lower capital requirements,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Materials, particularly those related to energy and infrastructure, could see a rebound if global economic activity accelerates. Consumer cyclicals should perform well if the U.S. economy maintains its momentum.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Indices in 2024</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While the S&amp;P 500 index was up 27.30% on a year-to-date basis as of Dec. 26 close, the <strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SPY#NYSE\">SPY</a>) has gained 27.23% in the same period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dow Jones Industrial Average and the <strong>SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/DIA#NYSE\">DIA</a>) were up 14.88% year-to-date as of the Dec. 26 close.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nasdaq 100 index which includes all the &#8220;Magnificent 7&#8221; stocks, unlike Dow, rose 31.58% year-to-date as Dec. 26 close. The ETF tracking the index, <strong>Fidelity NASDAQ Composite Index ETF</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ONEQ#NASDAQ\">ONEQ</a>) rose by 35.60% in the same period.

        "content": "<p>A key market narrative of 2024 has been the U.S. Dollar&#8217;s remarkable strength, with data showing that it is trading at levels last seen 22 years ago in 2002. Wall Street is anticipating this bullish momentum to continue into the new year as President-elect <strong>Donald Trump</strong>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/startups/24/10/41561517/trump-pushes-forward-with-controversial-tariff-plan-despite-growing-backlash-from-voters-who-strongl\">proposed tax cuts and tariff hikes</a> act as a tailwind.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dollar In 2024</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dollar index is up 6.73% year-to-date with a 52-week range of 100.1570 to 108.5410 per unit. If the Greenback can hold on to these gains, the currency would leave behind the second-best year in terms of annual gains since 2015.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The currency hit its 2024 high at 108.541 after the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee delivered a 25 basis point cut on Dec. 17. The FOMC anticipates only two cuts in 2025 as compared to four announced during the September meeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">JPMorgan On U.S. Dollar</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>JPMorgan Research anticipates further appreciation of the U.S. dollar in the near future, potentially reaching new highs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Meera Chandan</strong>, co-head of Global FX Strategy at JPMorgan, explains, &#8220;The recent election outcome has created a confluence of factors favoring a stronger dollar: diminished global growth prospects, widening economic disparities between the U.S. and other nations, and upward revisions to the terminal Fed funds rate for 2025. This combination represents a powerful set of cyclical drivers for the USD.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chandan acknowledges that these are initial assessments and may be subject to adjustments as the policy implications of the Trump administration become clearer next year. Nevertheless, she emphasizes that &#8220;for now, they provide a compelling economic justification for maintaining a long USD position through the first quarter of 2025.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">RBC Capital On US Dollar</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the analysts at RBC Capital, 2025 is set to be an interesting year as Trump takes office on Jan. 20, promising to deliver big policy changes in the U.S. Early appointments point to a desire to hit the ground running on at least three main pillars of change: (1) deregulation, (2) tariffs, (3) immigration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We struggle, as everyone does, to know what portion of Trump rhetoric we should bake into our outlook. As former Canadian Prime Minister <strong>Stephen Harper</strong> put it, &#8216;Trump should be taken seriously, but not literally&#8217;,&#8221; the note said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The long USD trade seems &#8216;obvious,&#8217; but we have tried to avoid it in our 2025 directional thematic trades. Like almost everyone else, we would rather be long USD than sort but with DXY at 107 and positioning already crowded heading into the new year, the risk-reward doesn't feel great,&#8221; the note said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the note by year-end 2025, a potential Fed tightening bias could further support USD, but with valuations near historical highs, carry may be the primary driver of gains. While a U.S. slowdown remains a downside risk, it appears less likely given the Trump administration&#8217;s deregulatory push.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/12/42678014/top-7-blue-chip-stocks-with-the-best-return-potential-going-into-2025\">Top 7 Blue-Chip Stocks With The Best Return Potential Going Into 2025</a> </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Capital Economics On USA</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <strong>Jonas Goltermann</strong>, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics, the U.S. dollar will appreciate further in 2025 as the economy and stock market outperform peers, and President-elect Donald Trump imposes significant tariffs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Republican sweep in the November elections triggered a broad dollar rally. We anticipate Trump will implement a 10% universal tariff and a 60% tariff on Chinese imports shortly after taking office, a move not yet fully priced in by markets, despite general optimism about the US economy and the dollar,&#8221; he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We think the adjustment to higher U.S. tariffs will lead to another leg higher in the dollar next year, taking the DXY index to ~110, near its 2022 peak. That might prompt more talk of a Plaza 2.0/Mar-a-Lago Accord, but we think that idea remains far-fetched.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">XM On USD</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Although there's not a lot on the horizon that can trigger a massive dollar selloff, its ability to continue marching higher hinges on the actual size of Trump's tax cuts and tariff increases that will eventually be approved,&#8221; said <strong>Raffi Boyadjian</strong>, lead investment analyst at XM.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Franklin Templeton On USD</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Franklin Templeton, &#8220;The Fed easing cycle will be a dominant factor for the USD. The two main comparisons we draw against the Fed cyclically, interest-rate-wise, are emerging markets, and Japan.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Shinhan Bank On USD</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The USD&#8217;s demand has been rising due to the &#8220;Uncertainties arising from expected Trump's policies and hawkish comments from the Fed towards rate cycle,&#8221; said <strong>Kunal Sodhani</strong>, vice president of the global trading center at Shinhan Bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price Action: </strong>According to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard\">Benzinga Pro</a> data, <strong>WisdomTree Bloomberg US Dollar Bullish Fund</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/USDU#NYSE\">USDU</a>) is up 13.04% on a year-to-date basis, as of Dec. 24 close, whereas <strong>Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/UUP#NYSE\">UUP</a>) advanced by 7.5% in the same period.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/26040921/USD-ETF-chart-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-707316\" srcset=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/26040921/USD-ETF-chart-1024x576.png 1024w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/26040921/USD-ETF-chart-300x169.png 300w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/26040921/USD-ETF-chart-768x432.png 768w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/26040921/USD-ETF-chart-1536x864.png 1536w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/26040921/USD-ETF-chart.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/12/42678014/top-7-blue-chip-stocks-with-the-best-return-potential-going-into-2025\">S&amp;P 500 Hits 57 All-Time Highs In Record-Breaking 2024: Magnificent 7 Drive 30% Of Nasdaq&#8217;s Surge</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo courtesy: Wikimedia</em></p>"

His insights gain particular relevance as cryptocurrency markets reach new heights in early 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Bubbles have this aspect where they are extremely hard to define, they involve these incredible abstractions,&#8221; Thiel said at Yale, drawing an implicit parallel to cryptocurrency markets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This observation comes months <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/08/40434156/peter-thiel-calls-bitcoin-moderately-big-invention-compared-with-the-internet-it-was-syste\">after his August appearance</a> on <strong>Joe Rogan</strong>&#8216;s podcast, where he called Bitcoin &#8220;a moderately big invention&#8221; that was &#8220;systematically underestimated for the first 10-11 years.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thiel&#8217;s second indicator focuses on exponential growth patterns. &#8220;Things that are exponential are extremely powerful but extremely unsustainable,&#8221; he explained. This perspective gains significance as Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization approaches record levels, with the cryptocurrency seeing a 47.73% gain in the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/movers/25/01/42757978/bitcoin-ethereum-dogecoin-begin-new-year-on-a-healthy-note-analyst-says-this-blue-chip-crypto-can-witness-good-amount-of-action-in-early-2025\">fourth quarter of 2024</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/25/01/42758021/roaring-kitty-keith-gill-sparks-speculation-with-rick-james-themed-post-on-x-gamestop-chewy-shares-in-focus\">&#8216;Roaring Kitty&#8217; Keith Gill Sparks Speculation With Rick James-Themed Post On X: GameStop, Chewy Shares In Focus \u2014 Unity Software Pops 12%</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The venture capitalist&#8217;s third indicator \u2013 psychosocial mania \u2013 particularly resonates with cryptocurrency markets. &#8220;There is a psychosocial component. It&#8217;s a sort of mania- the tulip bubble,&#8221; Thiel noted, referencing the 17th-century Dutch tulip bubble that many critics compare to <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/education/17/12/10940893/this-graph-shows-the-bitcoin-obsession-has-surpassed-tulip-mania\">today&#8217;s cryptocurrency markets</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these cautionary frameworks, Thiel&#8217;s Founders Fund <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/07/39569413/billionaire-peter-thiel-voices-skepticism-on-bitcoins-future-growth-im-not-sure-its-going-\">reportedly invested $200 million</a> in Bitcoin and <strong>Ethereum</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/eth/usd\">ETH</a>) in late 2023. However, by July, Thiel expressed skepticism about Bitcoin&#8217;s future growth potential, stating in a CNBC interview, &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s going to go up that dramatically from here.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The billionaire&#8217;s insights come as PayPal, the company he co-founded, continues to <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/09/41038635/paypal-steps-up-crypto-game-allows-us-merchants-to-buy-sell-and-hold-digital-assets\">expand its cryptocurrency services</a>, bridging traditional finance with digital assets.

        "date": "2025-01-02T09:08:27Z",
        "summary": "Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Ukraine are also contributing to the bullish outlook for gold.",
        "content": "<p>Gold prices are expected to continue their upward trajectory in 2025, though at a slower pace compared to last year's remarkable 27% rally. Analysts anticipate a 7% increase from current levels by the end of the year, signaling a more moderate yet steady rise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Wall Street analysts project that gold prices will climb to about $2,795 per troy ounce by the end of 2025, a 7% increase from current levels, Financial Times <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9fa96c1d-03f2-4d25-9644-b29ae19407aa\">reported</a> on Thursday. This forecast comes on the heels of significant central bank purchases, which saw global institutions buy 694 tonnes of gold in the first nine months of 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key drivers of the expected increase include central banks' diversification away from the U.S. dollar following sanctions on Russia, anticipated interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve, and rising concerns about U.S. government debt under President-elect <strong>Donald Trump</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Henrik Marx</strong>, global head of trading at Heraeus Precious Metals, said, &#8220;Whatever he announces will increase debt, leading to a weaker dollar and increased inflation. That is usually a nice mixture for gold.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Ukraine are also contributing to the bullish outlook for gold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/tech/25/01/42757901/elon-musk-fireworks-or-explosive-device-caused-fatal-cybertruck-incident-at-las-vegas-trump-hotel-vehicle-was-rented\">Elon Musk: Fireworks Or Explosive Device Caused Fatal Cybertruck Incident At Las Vegas Trump Hotel; Vehicle Was Rented</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> has issued the most optimistic forecast, expecting prices to hit $3,000 per troy ounce by year's end. Meanwhile, <strong>Barclays</strong> and <strong>Macquarie</strong> have issued more conservative projections, predicting a drop to approximately $2,500 per troy ounce, a 4% decline from current levels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Momentum is taking back over, combined with geopolitical tensions, which is going to add more fuel to the fire,\" said <strong>Michael Haigh</strong>, head of commodities research at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Haigh predicts that gold prices could reach $2,900 per troy ounce by the end of 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Gold's role as a safe-haven asset remains prominent amid global economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions. Central banks have been increasingly diversifying their reserves, moving away from the dollar to mitigate risks. The World Gold Council has described this year's growth as \"positive but much more modest\" compared to 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the rise of alternative assets like Bitcoin ETFs is also reshaping the investment landscape.

        "summary": "Tesla&#39;s Cybertruck now qualifies for $7,500 EV tax credit, but Trump may end subsidies. Elon Musk supports ending all subsidies.",
        "content": "<p><strong>Tesla Inc.&#8217;s</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a>) Cybertruck now qualifies for $7,500 electric vehicle consumer tax credits, the U.S. government confirmed on its fueleconomy.gov\u00a0website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Upon taking delivery of the Cybertruck this year, customers can get an EV tax credit of $7,500 on both the dual motor variant and the single motor variant of the stainless steel truck. Tesla is yet to start production of the single-motor variant of the truck but it will qualify for the tax credit once the company starts selling it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the tax credit, the effective starting price of the Cybertruck all-wheel variant will go down to $72,490 for those who qualify. The rear-wheel drive single-motor variant will start at $53,490 after the tax credit once delivery starts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cyberbeast premium variant of the Cybertruck will likely not qualify for the tax credit given its starting price of $99,990, which is over the $80,000 price limit for the tax credit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, all variants of the Model Y and Model 3 in addition to the Model X all-wheel drive variant sold in the U.S. are also eligible for $7,500&nbsp;electric vehicle consumer tax credits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>However, the very existence of the electric vehicle consumer tax credits is currently in question. In November, Reuters reported that President-elect <strong>Donald Trump&#8217;s</strong> transition team is planning to kill the $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicle purchases as part of broader tax-reform legislation. Tesla representatives reportedly supported the proposal to end the subsidy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"In my view, we should end all government subsidies, including those for EVs, oil and gas,\" Tesla CEO <strong>Elon Musk</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/11/42005034/elon-musk-backs-calls-for-end-to-ev-subsidies-but-former-tesla-exec-warns-of-massive-drop-in-manufacturing-investments-if-trump-follows-through\">wrote on X</a> following the report. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During Tesla&#8217;s second-quarter earnings in late July, Musk alleged that the impact of the elimination of subsidies&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/07/39934750/trump-presidency-and-ira-cut-would-be-devastating-for-competitors-says-elon-musk-long-term-probably\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">would only be slight for Tesla</a>&nbsp;but devastating for its competitors. The elimination of EV subsidies would probably help Tesla in the long term, he added. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, not all are in agreement. According to&nbsp;<strong>The Future Fund</strong>&nbsp;Managing Partner&nbsp;<strong>Gary Black</strong>, the killing of the consumer tax credit will have a negative impact on Tesla's EPS similar to the one experienced by the company when it resorted to price cuts to increase delivery volume in 2023. The decision will likely not impact legacy automakers given EVs are only a small segment of their business,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/global/24/11/41998381/tesla-earnings-will-be-hit-hardest-if-7500-ev-credit-is-cut-warns-gary-black-citing-80-dependence-on-ev-sales-please-do-the-math\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">he added</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Check out more of Benzinga&#8217;s Future Of Mobility coverage by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/mobility\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">following this link.</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42758540/us-listed-chinese-ev-startups-clock-delivery-growth-in-december-li-auto-tops-the-chart-mona-m03-spurs-xpeng-nios-onvo-breaches-10000-monthly-delivery-milestone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">US-Listed Chinese EV Startups Clock Delivery Growth In December: Li Auto Tops Charts, Mona M03 Spurs XPeng, Nio's Onvo Breaches 10,000 Monthly Delivery Milestone</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo courtesy: Tesla</em></p>"

        "content": "<p>The absence of the traditional &#8220;Santa Claus rally&#8221; has caught the attention of financial experts. This rally, typically observed at the end of the year, has not materialized, prompting discussions among analysts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: <strong>Mark Luschini</strong>,&nbsp;chief investment strategist at Janney&nbsp;Montgomery Scott, noted the &#8220;unusual&#8221; absence of the Santa Claus rally, a trend often seen at year-end, Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/hopes-for-a-santa-claus-rally-fade-on-wall-street-0a129e0b\">reported </a>on Thursday. Historically, when the&nbsp;S&amp;P 500&nbsp;experienced this rally, it averaged a 10.4%&nbsp;gain in the new year, based on CFRA Research data since 1945.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even without a year-end rally, the S&amp;P 500 generally sees an average annual gain of 5.7%. However, in 2024, the index returned over 23%, breaking an eight-year streak of aligning with this trend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jordan Rizzuto</strong>,&nbsp;managing partner at <strong>GammaRoad Capital&nbsp;Partners</strong>, said, \"It's markets, right? So anything is possible,\" said Jordan Rizzuto, managing partner at GammaRoad Capital Partners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/24/12/42735744/pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-predicts-doom-for-michael-saylors-microstrategy-as-stock-dips-below-300-in-after-hours-trading?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8216;Pharma Bro&#8217; Martin Shkreli Predicts Liquidation Doom For MicroStrategy Amid Fall Below $300, Says Bitcoin Will Hit $250K Without Michael Saylor</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: Santa Rally fizzling out is not a new phenomenon. 2023 experienced a similar instance with market analyst\u00a0<strong>Martin Tillier</strong>\u00a0highlighted this in his op-ed, noting significant losses at the start of 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, the Santa Claus rally refers to stock market gains during\u00a0the last five trading days\u00a0of one year and the\u00a0first two of the next. However, 2024 saw a deviation from the pattern, with futures signaling further declines, as <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-the-santa-claus-rally-died-and-what-that-means-for-investors\">reported</a> by Nasdaq.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tiller\u00a0suggested that the rally&#8217;s absence might be due to market expectations already factoring in anticipated good news\u00a0for the first half of\u00a0the year. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s expected rate cuts were believed to bolster the rally, but the market&#8217;s pullback suggested otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The absence of the Santa Claus rally has raised questions about its impact on the market. In December, the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/23/12/36350421/is-the-santa-rally-over-what-it-means-for-stocks-in-2024\">S&amp;P 500 index</a>\u00a0experienced a 14% increase, buoyed by a dovish Federal Reserve. However, a sudden 1.4% drop left investors puzzled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concerns about the potential disruption of the Santa Claus rally were also highlighted by&nbsp;<strong>Lawrence G. McMillan</strong>, a seasoned trader. He warned of a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/12/42698415/expert-warns-of-potential-grinch-pinch-impacting-santa-claus-rally-the-outlook-for-stocks-can-be-quite-negative\">possible &#8220;Grinch pinch&#8221;</a> impacting this seasonal market phenomenon. Despite positive market indicators, McMillan cautioned that the market remains within a broad trading range, with significant resistance and support levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price Action:</strong> <span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Benzinga Pro</a>,&nbsp;<strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust</strong>&nbsp;(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SPY#NYSE\">SPY</a>) dropped 2.91% in the past month, while&nbsp;<strong>Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/QQQ#NASDAQ\">QQQ</a>) was down&nbsp;</span>0.79% during the same period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/24/12/42739155/elon-musk-changes-his-name-to-kekius-maximus-on-x-sending-to-memecoin-skyrocketing-over-600?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Elon Musk Changes His Name To &#8216;Kekius Maximus&#8217; On X, Sending This Memecoin Skyrocketing Over 600%</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Disclaimer</em></strong><em>: This content was partially produced with the help of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/author/benzinga-neuro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Benzinga Neuro</a>&nbsp;and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image via Shutterstock</em></p>"

        "content": "<p><strong>MicroStrategy Inc.</strong>\u00a0(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSTR#NASDAQ\">MSTR</a>) experienced a notable 5.87% increase in its stock during pre-market trading on Thursday. This surge is attributed to a significant rise in <strong>Bitcoin&#8217;</strong>s (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/btc/usd\">BTC</a>) price, which reached $96,578.38, as per\u00a0<a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/\">Benzinga Pro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024,\u00a0MicroStrategy\u00a0was a prominent player in the crypto-linked asset sector, achieving an impressive 342% gain year-to-date. However, the stock has recently faced challenges, experiencing over 23% decline over the past month. As of the last closing at $289.62, it has fallen\u00a0below its eight, 20, and\u00a050-day simple moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these pressures, the stock remains&nbsp;above its 200-day moving average&nbsp;of $195.03, suggesting some long-term bullish potential. Analysts have set&nbsp;a consensus price target of&nbsp;$449.5 for&nbsp;MicroStrategy, with BTIG providing the highest target of $690 on Dec. 11, 2023, and Jefferies offering the lowest at $140 on Nov. 10, 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/12/42745703/shark-tanks-barbara-corcoran-says-ex-boyfriend-left-her-for-younger-and-prettier-secretary-after-giving-her-1000-to-start-a-business?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Shark Tank&#8217;s Barbara Corcoran Says Ex-Boyfriend Left Her For &#8216;Younger And Prettier&#8217; Secretary After Giving Her $1,000 To Start A Business</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent analyst ratings from&nbsp;<strong>Bernstein, TD Cowen</strong>, and <strong>Barclays</strong>, released in late 2024, suggest&nbsp;an average price target of&nbsp;$546.67.

The company&#8217;s strategy of investing heavily in Bitcoin has led to significant gains, but it also exposes the stock to volatility. While 2024 was a stellar year for MicroStrategy, the stock has recently <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/24/12/42740882/microstrategys-bitcoin-play-stellar-year-but-december-doldrums-loom-large\">encountered a bearish turn</a>, reflecting the challenges of navigating the crypto market&#8217;s ups and downs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Galaxy Research forecasts that <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/12/42724952/2025-outlook-bitcoin-to-150000-ethereum-to-5500-dogecoin-hits-1-galaxy-research-predicts\">Bitcoin could surpass $150,000</a> in the first half of 2025, with the potential to hit or exceed $185,000 by the fourth quarter.

However, BEV market share will increase across Europe, the U.S., China, and India, it added. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The firm now expects 89.5 million new vehicles to be sold globally next year, marking a growth of 1.7% year-on-year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;2025 is shaping up to be ultra-challenging for the auto industry, as key regional demand factors limit demand potential and the new US administration adds fresh uncertainty from day one,&#8221; said&nbsp;<strong>Colin Couchman</strong>, executive director of global light vehicle forecasting for S&amp;P Global Mobility, in a statement. &#8220;A key concern is how &#8216;natural&#8217; EV demand fares as governments rethink policy support, especially incentives and subsidies, industrial policy, tariffs, and fast-evolving OEM target setting.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Beyond 2025, the firm sees many factors <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/24/12/42600762/where-ev-stocks-are-going-in-2025\">impacting the EV transition</a>, including charging infrastructure, battery supply chains, tariff trade barriers, and more. There is also less certainty around President-elect Donald Trump&#8217;s support for electric vehicles, the firm noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the U.S. alone, S&amp;P expects vehicle sales volume to touch 16.2 million units in 2025, marking a 1.2% growth from the 16 million projected for 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;New vehicle affordability issues that coalesced to constrain auto demand levels for much of 2024 will not be resolved quickly in 2025. Vehicle pricing levels are expected to decline but remain high; interest rates are expected to shift further downwards, but inflation levels are anticipated to remain sticky, and new vehicle inventory should also progress, but careful management is expected too,&#8221; said&nbsp;<strong>Chris Hopson</strong>, manager of North American light vehicle sales forecasting for S&amp;P Global Mobility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Check out more of Benzinga's Future Of Mobility coverage by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/mobility\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">following this link.</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42758540/us-listed-chinese-ev-startups-clock-delivery-growth-in-december-li-auto-tops-the-chart-mona-m03-spurs-xpeng-nios-onvo-breaches-10000-monthly-delivery-milestone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">US-Listed Chinese EV Startups Clock Delivery Growth In December: Li Auto Tops Charts, Mona M03 Spurs XPeng, Nio&#8217;s Onvo Breaches 10,000 Monthly Delivery Milestone</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo courtesy: Shutterstock</em></p>"

While KBW slightly increased its price target, it expressed concerns about SOFI&#8217;s lofty valuation, deeming its long-term earnings potential insufficient to justify the current stock price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brokerage emphasized the challenges of achieving ambitious earnings targets, citing the need for significant revenue growth and margin improvement. KBW concluded that the current risk-reward profile for SOFI investors leans heavily toward potential losses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard\">Benzinga Pro</a>, the stock was nearly three times more expensive than its peers.

The 20-day moving average price was $15.86 apiece. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These simple moving averages represent the average price of the security over the specified number of days.

        "content": "<p>Amid growing concerns over&nbsp;<strong>Donald Trump</strong>&#8216;s economic policies, a recent survey reveals that economists are wary of the potential negative impacts of his &#8220;Maganomics&#8221; strategy. This comes as Trump prepares for a possible&nbsp;return to the White House.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: According to a\u00a0Financial Times\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6f58952-a0ad-4db2-ac70-2b8f075c7ada\">reported </a>on Thursday, a survey of over 220 economists across the US, UK, and Eurozone reveals concerns about Trump&#8217;s economic strategy, dubbed &#8220;Maganomics.&#8221; The poll suggests that Trump&#8217;s protectionist policies may impede growth despite investor optimism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many economists believe that Trump&#8217;s&nbsp;return to the White House&nbsp;could lead to inflation and cautious Federal Reserve actions on interest rates.&nbsp;<strong>\u015eebnem Kalemli-\u00d6zcan</strong>,&nbsp;a professor at Brown University, stated that while Trump&#8217;s policies might spur short-term growth, they could also result in a global slowdown, eventually affecting the US negatively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey, conducted with the University of Chicago&#8217;s Booth School of Business, found that\u00a0more than half of the\u00a0economists expect some negative impact from Trump&#8217;s agenda. This includes plans for significant tariffs and deportations, which are seen as inflationary and potentially harmful to growth, according to\u00a0<strong>Janice Eberly</strong>\u00a0of Northwestern University.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/market-summary/25/01/42758695/sp-500s-record-breaking-2024-ends-with-four-day-slump-history-suggests-bullish-days-ahead?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">S&amp;P 500&#8217;s Record-Breaking 2024 Ends With Four-Day Slump \u2014 History Suggests Bullish Days Ahead</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Barret Kupelian</strong>, chief economist at PwC UK, added, \"The Trump administration will be an \u2018unpredictability machine' which will dissuade business and households from taking long-term decisions with ease. This will inevitably have an economic cost.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these concerns, the U.S. economy is projected to grow faster than Europe&#8217;s in 2025. However, Eurozone economists are particularly worried about the impact on manufacturing, especially in Germany. The U.K.&#8217;s large services sector may offer some insulation, but uncertainty remains a concern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: Trump&#8217;s economic strategies have been a focal point of discussion, especially his <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/01/42754775/dollar-strength-to-be-driven-by-trumps-deregulation-tariff-and-tax-policies-in-2025-after-a-strong-2024\">proposed tariff hikes</a> and deregulation policies. In 2024, the U.S. Dollar experienced significant strength, reaching levels not seen since 2002. Analysts predict this trend may continue into 2025, bolstered by Trump&#8217;s tax cuts and tariff increases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, these policies also pose risks.\u00a0Goldman Sachs\u00a0has warned that<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/24/12/42291861/trumps-tariff-plan-risks-economic-pain-for-north-america-goldman-sachs-warns\"> Trump&#8217;s aggressive tariff plans</a> could lead to economic challenges for North America, with potential GDP contractions for Canada and Mexico. The U.S. could also face a slowdown in growth, highlighting the complex implications of Trump&#8217;s economic agenda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/market-summary/24/12/42719119/us-stock-futures-slip-after-fridays-fall-santa-rally-in-doubt-analyst-calls-it-a-bit-of-profit-taking?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">US Stock Futures Slip After Friday&#8217;s Fall: &#8216;Santa Rally&#8217; In Doubt?

        "summary": "Acuity Brands offers an annual dividend yield of 0.21%. How can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?",
        "content": "<p class=\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><strong>Acuity Brands, Inc.</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AYI#NYSE\">AYI</a>) will release earnings results for its first quarter, before the opening <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/AYI/earnings\">bell on Thursday, Jan. 9.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analysts expect the Atlanta-based company to report quarterly earnings at $3.87 per share, up from $3.72 per share in the year-ago period. Acuity Brands projects to report quarterly revenue at $956.32 million, compared to $934.7 million a year earlier, according to data from <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard\">Benzinga Pro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the recent buzz around Acuity Brands, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Acuity Brands offers an annual dividend yield of 0.21%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 15 cents per share (60 cents a year).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $2,921,300 or around 10,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $584,260 or around 2,000 shares.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To calculate: </strong>Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($0.60 in this case). So, $6,000 / $0.60 = 10,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $0.60 = 2,000 shares ($100 per month).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How that works:</strong> The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock&#8217;s current price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price Action:</strong> Shares of Acuity Brands fell 0.7% to close at $292.13 on Tuesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Oct. 24, Acuity Brands agreed to acquire <strong>QSC, LLC</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How to Find Dividend Stocks: Scan, Analyze, and Capture with Benzinga Pro\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pVF0O2lsEH4?start=1&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read More: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/12/42740135/how-to-earn-500-a-month-from-alphabet-stock\">How To Earn $500 A Month From Alphabet Stock</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>"

        "content": "<p><em>Editor&#8217;s Note: The article has been updated with comments from Ryan Air </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong>RyanAir Holdings plc\u00a0</strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/RYAAY#NASDAQ\">RYAAY</a>) flight en route from Riga to Vienna had to divert reportedly due to interference with its GPS signal over Poland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: A&nbsp;RyanAir&nbsp;flight from Riga to Vienna was forced to divert due to GPS signal interference over Poland, as <a href=\"https://www.diepresse.com/19215484/ryanair-flug-kann-wegen-gestoerter-gps-signale-nicht-in-wien-landen?ref=ues_a\">reported</a> by&nbsp;Die Presse&nbsp;on Tuesday. The flight, identified as FR 748,&nbsp;attempted to land in Vienna&nbsp;twice but was unsuccessful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The captain of the Airbus A320 announced minor technical issues, causing unrest among passengers. Eventually, the aircraft landed safely in Brno, Czech Republic, where the captain explained that the GPS disruption was linked to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, a frequent occurrence in the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/12/42716303/donald-trump-claims-black-celebrities-were-paid-for-kamala-harris-endorsements?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Donald Trump Claims Black Celebrities Were Paid for Kamala Harris Endorsements</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to poor visibility, a safe landing in Vienna was not possible without precise positioning, as reported by Die Presse. The weather conditions in Brno were more favorable, allowing for a safe landing, which was met with applause from relieved passengers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the technical issue\u00a0could not be resolved at\u00a0Brno airport, necessitating the transport of passengers to Vienna by bus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Flight FR748 from Riga to Vienna yesterday Mon 30 Dec diverted to Bruno due to a minor tech issue with the GPS system combined with low visibility (fog) at Vienna. The aircraft landed normally at Bruno at 22.52 local, where there was no issue with visibility, and passengers were transported by coach to Vienna. We sincerely apologise to passengers for any inconvenience caused as a result of this diversion,&#8221; a spokesperson from Ryan Air told Benzinga. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Airbus has yet to respond to Benzinga&#8217;s queries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The incident involving RyanAir&#8217;s flight FR 748 comes just days after an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/12/42714362/azerbaijan-airlines-flight-hit-by-external-interference-over-russia-before-fatal-crash\">Azerbaijan Airlines flight</a>&nbsp;experienced &#8220;external interference&#8221; over Russia, leading to a fatal crash in Kazakhstan. The aircraft, a Brazilian-made Embraer 190, was diverted due to damage sustained during the flight, resulting in 38 casualties. Passengers reported hearing blasts, raising concerns about regional air defense systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, another tragic incident occurred at South Korea&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/travel/24/12/42715729/tragic-plane-crash-at-s-koreas-muan-international-airport-181-on-board\">Muan International Airport</a>, where a Jeju Air flight crashed during landing, killing several passengers. The B737-800 aircraft collided with the airport's outer runway wall, causing the plane to break apart and subsequently catch fire.

        "content": "<p>The tech world in 2025 is set to be defined by resilience, consolidation, and the unstoppable rise <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/artificial-intelligence\">of Edge AI</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee has unveiled his top predictions for hardware and networking in 2025, and it's clear: the year will be all about resilience, edge AI, and a few surprising twists. Here's what investors need to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Apple, Edge AI: 2 Hot Tickets For 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Chatterjee is betting on <strong>Apple Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\">AAPL</a>) to flex its muscles. He sees iPhone 17 hype and the rise of Edge AI keeping investors hooked. Forget the valuation debates\u2014AI integration in smartphones and PCs could make Apple untouchable for much of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While hyperscalers may grapple with AI scaling debates, Edge AI will steal the spotlight. By December, expect it to solidify as the darling of the tech world, powering smarter gadgets and keeping investors excited well into 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI's ROI remains focused on cost-cutting rather than driving revenue gains. Enterprises will stick to the basics, leveraging AI for leaner operations rather than headline-grabbing revenue boosts, the analyst said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42758055/tim-cook-sundar-pichai-elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg-and-more-how-top-tech-ceos-ushered-in-2025-with-new-year-cheers-and-big-dreams\">Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, And More: Tech Moguls Post Upbeat New Year Greetings: &#8216;Have A Good Feeling About 2025&#8217;</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cloud Wars Favor Hardware</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The long-running tug-of-war between on-premise and cloud infrastructure tilts toward hardware in 2025. According to Chatterjee, companies like <strong>Dell Technologies Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/DELL#NASDAQ\">DELL</a>) and <strong>Cisco Systems Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/CSCO#NASDAQ\">CSCO</a>) could shrug off fears of cloud dominance as enterprises reconsider the cloud's ROI for AI workloads.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">AI Stocks: A Rollercoaster Ride</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It won't be smooth sailing for AI-leveraged players like <strong>Arista Networks Inc</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ANET#NYSE\">ANET</a>) and <strong>Coherent Corp</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/COHR#NYSE\">COHR</a>), per Chatterjee. Early-year uncertainty will weigh on shares until mid-year earnings provide clarity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investors will wait for the likes of <strong>Nvidia Corp</strong>'s (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NVDA#NASDAQ\">NVDA</a>) Blackwell and 800G Ethernet switching to gain traction.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Valuation Squeeze, <strong>Cyclicality To Spark M&amp;A Frenzy</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Premium valuations across the hardware sector will narrow the gap between winners and laggards, says Chatterjee. The year's theme? Find value in the underdogs or wait for M&amp;A opportunities to unlock hidden potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Telco, enterprise, and cable players gear up for a cyclical rebound, consolidation could heat up. Chatterjee predicts stronger players will snap up rivals to amplify recovery gains and slash costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contract Manufacturers: The New Favorites</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically overshadowed by OEMs, contract manufacturers are ready to shine. Lower risks, better margins, and ties to AI infrastructure projects could make them 2025's surprise winners.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tariff Troubles Overblown</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Worried about tariffs? Don't be. Chatterjee expects years of supply chain investments to shield companies from the worst, leaving doomsayers scratching their heads as stocks rise.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">EV, AV: Hype Fatigue Sets In</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Electric and autonomous vehicles will face another year of growing pains. With U.S. EV subsidies on shaky ground and slower progress in autonomous tech, optimism might fizzle\u2014except for robotaxis, which could gain traction in tightly controlled spaces, says Chatterjee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>JPMorgan's vision for 2025 is clear: edge AI is the growth engine, Apple stays unstoppable, and consolidation could define the year. For investors, it's a roadmap to navigate the tech sector's next big moves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/media/25/01/42759147/apple-discounts-iphone-16-prices-in-china-by-up-to-68-5-as-it-battles-huaweis-resurgence-in-the-country\">Apple Discounts iPhone 16 Prices In China By Up To $68.5 As It Battles Huawei&#8217;s Resurgence In The Country</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: ImageFlow/ Shutterstock.com</em></p>"

Aon's analysis reveals that these medications could add 1% to overall healthcare cost increases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite their low utilization, these therapies significantly impact employer healthcare budgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On average, U.S. employers cover 81% of health plan costs, leaving employees to pay 19%, amounting to $4,858 annually, including premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024, employer healthcare budgets grew by 6.4%, while employee premiums increased by a more modest 3.4%, according to Aon's analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The technology and communications sector experienced the highest employer cost increase at 7.4% in 2024, while public sector employees faced the steepest rise in contributions at 6.7%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, the healthcare industry saw no material change in employee contributions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>High-cost claims stemming from gene and cell therapies, complex medical procedures, and chronic conditions further strain employer budgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price Action:</strong> LLY stock is up 0.88% at $778.79 during the premarket session at the last check on Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/contracts/25/01/42763712/arcos-dorados-renews-franchise-agreement-with-mcdonalds-stock-gains\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Arcos Dorados Renews Franchise Agreement With McDonald's, Stock Gains</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo by Ciara Kimsey via Shutterstock</em></p>"

The MBA reported that mortgage applications fell 12.6% during the same week, compounding a 10.7% decline from the previous period. Seasonally adjusted, this leaves mortgage volumes at their lowest level in 10 months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sharp drop suggests that higher rates are squeezing demand, with many prospective buyers either unable or unwilling to lock in mortgages under such unfavorable conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Labor Market Shows Resilience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On the flip side, labor market data offered a glimmer of optimism, as initial jobless claims fell to 211,000 in the week ending Dec. 28, down from 219,000 the previous week and beating market expectations of 222,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Continuing claims, which track those already receiving unemployment benefits, also dipped to 1.844 million, the lowest level since late September and below forecasts of 1.890 million. The steady decline in claims suggests that the U.S. job market remains robust in the face of rising borrowing costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Market Reactions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Thursday delivered a dose of optimism for markets as risk sentiment rebounded sharply ahead of the first trading session of the new year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following Tuesday&#8217;s selloff, major equity futures jumped in early trading. As of 8:40 a.m. ET, contracts on the S&amp;P 500 climbed 1%. Meanwhile, futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 jumped 1.2%. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) \u2014 as tracked by the\u00a0<strong>Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/UUP#NYSE\">UUP</a>) \u2014 rose 0.3% to 108.80 levels, reaching the highest since November 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Now: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42761107/us-stocks-to-open-higher-in-the-first-trading-session-of-2025-analyst-says-history-favors-rebound-after-year-end-dip\">US Stocks To Open Higher In The First Trading Session Of 2025: Analyst Says History Favors Rebound After Year-End Dip</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>"

average by <b>7.59x</b> suggests company might be overvalued based on its book value.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Price to Sales ratio of <b>29.48</b>, which is <b>3.04x</b> the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With a Return on Equity (ROE) of <b>31.13%</b> that is <b>27.05%</b> above the industry average, it appears that the company exhibits efficient use of equity to generate profits.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Compared to its industry, the company has lower Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of <b>$22.86 Billion</b>, which is <b>0.68x</b> below the industry average, potentially indicating lower profitability or financial challenges.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With lower gross profit of <b>$26.16 Billion</b>, which indicates <b>0.96x</b> below the industry average, the company may experience lower revenue after accounting for production costs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The company is experiencing remarkable revenue growth, with a rate of <b>93.61%</b>, outperforming the industry average of <b>8.01%</b>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Debt To Equity Ratio</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2025/1735830007_0.png\" alt=\"debt to equity\" /></p>\n\n<p>The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio assesses the extent to which a company relies on borrowed funds compared to its equity.</p>\n<p>Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making.</p>\n<p>When comparing NVIDIA with its top 4 peers based on the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights can be observed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Compared to its top 4 peers, NVIDIA has a stronger financial position indicated by its lower debt-to-equity ratio of <b>0.16</b>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This suggests that the company relies less on debt financing and has a more favorable balance between debt and equity, which can be seen as a positive attribute by investors.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<p>The low P/E ratio suggests that NVIDIA may be undervalued compared to its peers in the Semiconductors &amp; Semiconductor Equipment industry. However, the high P/B and P/S ratios indicate that the market values the company's assets and sales more highly. On the other hand, the high ROE, revenue growth, and low EBITDA and gross profit ratios suggest that NVIDIA is generating strong returns on equity and experiencing significant revenue growth, despite lower profitability margins.</p>\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.</em></p>"

Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips.

financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making.</p>\n<p>By analyzing Meta Platforms in relation to its top 4 peers based on the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights can

Earnings ratio significantly exceeds the industry average by <b>2.22x</b>, suggesting a premium valuation relative to industry peers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The elevated Price to Book ratio of <b>8.9</b> relative to the industry average by <b>1.68x</b> suggests company might be overvalued based on its book value.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The stock's relatively high Price to Sales ratio of <b>3.78</b>, surpassing the industry average by <b>2.26x</b>, may indicate an aspect of overvaluation in terms of sales performance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With a Return on Equity (ROE) of <b>6.19%</b> that is <b>0.93%</b> below the industry average, it appears that the company exhibits potential inefficiency in utilizing equity to generate profits.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of <b>$32.08 Billion</b>, which is <b>4.6x</b> above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With higher gross profit of <b>$31.0 Billion</b>, which indicates <b>2.15x</b> above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The company's revenue growth of <b>11.04%</b> exceeds the industry average of <b>7.84%</b>, indicating strong sales performance and market

debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a measure that indicates the level of debt a company has taken on relative to the value of its assets net of liabilities.</p>\n<p>Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making.</p>\n<p>By analyzing Amazon.com in relation to its top 4 peers based on the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights can be derived:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Among its top 4 peers, Amazon.com has a stronger financial position with a lower debt-to-equity ratio of <b>0.52</b>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This indicates that the company relies less on debt financing and maintains a more favorable balance between debt and equity, which can be viewed positively by investors.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<p>For Amazon.com, the PE, PB, and PS ratios are all high compared to its peers in the Broadline Retail industry, indicating that the stock may be overvalued. The low ROE suggests that Amazon.com is not generating significant returns on shareholder equity. However, the high EBITDA, gross profit, and revenue growth show strong operational performance and potential for future growth within the industry sector.</p>\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.</em></p>"

A low P/E ratio can be an indication of undervaluation, but it can also suggest weak growth prospects or financial instability. Moreover, the P/E ratio is just one of many metrics that investors should consider when making investment decisions, and it should be evaluated alongside other financial ratios, industry trends, and qualitative factors.

The company says these improvements are critical for advancing quantum computing toward practical applications in cryptography, optimization and drug discovery. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rigetti Computing says the system also delivers fast gate speeds\u201472-nanosecond median times for iSWAP and 56 nanoseconds for fSim\u2014ideal for complex data processing tasks like random circuit sampling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company says the machine is now accessible through Rigetti Quantum Cloud Services and will debut on platforms like <strong>Amazon Braket</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong> in early 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rigetti&#8217;s forward-looking plans include a modular 36-qubit system in mid-2025 and a 100+ qubit system by year-end, with further reductions in error rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CEO <strong>Dr. Subodh Kulkarni</strong> in December also highlighted Rigetti&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/24/12/g42646200/rigetti-computing-launches-84-qubit-ankaa-3-system-achieves-99-5-median-two-qubit-gate-fidelity-mi\">$225 million cash position</a> and absence of debt, emphasizing confidence in delivering its roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42766117/tesla-stock-tumbles-on-q4-deliveries-whats-going-on\">Tesla Stock Tumbles On Q4 Deliveries: What&#8217;s Going On?</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How To Buy RGTI Stock</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Rigetti Computing &#8211; be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-stock-trading-platforms\">possible trading platforms here.</a> Many will allow you to buy \u2018fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the the case of Rigetti Computing, which is trading at $15.58 as of publishing time, $100 would buy you 6.42 shares of stock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to \u2018go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock\">stock can be found at this resource.</a> Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading &#8211; either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to data from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/register174\">Benzinga Pro</a>, RGTI has a 52-week high of $19.35 and a 52-week low of $0.66.</p>"

While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued, it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth. Additionally, the P/E ratio should not be used in isolation, as other factors such as industry trends and business cycles can also impact a company's stock price. Therefore, investors should use the P/E ratio in conjunction with other financial metrics and qualitative analysis to make informed investment decisions. </p>"

The truck's owner said he rents out five vehicles on Turo for a secondary income source but plans to stop this practice after the attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/24/12/42642606/elon-musk-wants-to-raise-a-tesla-fleet-expert-estimates-vehicle-owners-can-make-40kyear-but-remains-doubtful\">Tesla Analyst Estimates Vehicle Owners Can Make $40,000 A Year By Renting EVs To Robotaxi Fleet That Elon Musk Likened To A Combination Of Airbnb And Uber, But Will It Take Off?</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Turo: </strong>The car-sharing company started in 2009 with venture capital backing, seeking to use a model similar to Airbnb to connect consumers with vehicles that were not being used by their owners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike traditional car rental companies, users on Turo can often find vehicles located in more convenient spots close to home or work instead of having to go to a car rental retail location. The rates and fees can also be cheaper when using Turo, although this can depend on the prices set by vehicle owners themselves on the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A November filing, shared by the New York Times, said around 3.5 million people have used Turo to book a vehicle and around 150,000 people have listed their vehicles for rent on the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to use the Turo platform, users have to create an account, have a valid driver's license and payment method. Users also have to be 18 years of age in the United States, which is younger than most car rental companies that set the minimum at 20 or 21. Turo also often checks credit history, auto insurance scores and criminal background history and is able to decline rentals and ban users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turo users do not need to have their own car insurance to rent a vehicle, as they can select from three protection plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In September, Turo <a href=\"https://turo.com/blog/news/uber-and-turo-partner-to-share-vehicles-on-uber-rent/\">announced </a>a partnership with <strong>Uber Technologies</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/UBER#NYSE\">UBER</a>). The partnership gives Uber customers the ability to rent vehicles from Turo directly through the Uber app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turo is available in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France and Australia, according to the company's website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What's Next</strong>: Turo filed paperwork to go public in 2022. It did not go public in 2024 and is one of many companies that mount a 2025 IPO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turo is backed by dozens of investors through multiple funding rounds.<strong> IAC Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/IAC#NASDAQ\">IAC</a>) is among the largest investors in the company, with a $250 million investment made in <a href=\"https://turo.com/blog/news/iac-invests-250-million-in-turo/\">2019 </a>at a valuation of $1 billion, helping to make the company the biggest shareholder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The car-sharing company had revenue of $880 million in 2023, up 18% year-over-year. The company's 2023 profit was $14.7 million, down from $154.7 million in 2022, as <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-turo-car-rental-app-las-vegas-new-orleans-2025-1\">reported </a>by Business Insider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance bought by the renters on Turo for the vehicles used in the Wednesday attacks and the insurance policies owned by the vehicle owners could become a key topic for Turo in connection with potential liability claims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue of approval of vehicle renters and Turo&#8217;s background check process are also likely to be in the spotlight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/global/25/01/42757919/joe-biden-addresses-new-orleans-attack-says-law-enforcement-probing-links-with-cybertruck-explosion-outside-trump-hotel-in-las-vegas\"><strong>Joe Biden Addresses New Orleans Attack Says Law Enforcement Probing Links With Cybertruck Explosion Outside Trump Hotel In Las Vegas</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo via Shutterstock. </em></p>"

Moreover, over the past month, the stock fell by <strong>10.91%</strong>, but in the past year, went up by <strong>16.78%</strong>.

It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against it's past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&amp;P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also could indicate that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. </p>\n<p>Beacon Roofing Supply has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of <strong>93.58</strong> of the Trading Companies &amp; Distributors industry. Ideally, one might believe that the stock might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued. </p>\n<p><p><img src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2025/1735837209_1.png\" alt=\"Guage\" /></p></p>\n<p>In conclusion, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric for analyzing a company's market performance, but it has its limitations. While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued, it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth. Additionally, the P/E ratio should not be used in isolation, as other factors such as industry trends and business cycles can also impact a company's stock price. Therefore, investors should use the P/E ratio in conjunction with other financial metrics and qualitative analysis to make informed investment decisions. </p>"

        "content": "<p>As the first trading month of the year kicks off, history suggests investors could be in <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets\">for a bullish ride. </a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>January has historically been a positive month for the S&amp;P 500, while one streaming giant has repeatedly delivered astonishing gains. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could this January follow suit? Let's break down the numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>S&amp;P 500: A New Year's Tradition Of Gains</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 index \u2014 tracked by the <strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SPY#NYSE\">SPY</a>) \u2014 has a long history of positive performance in January, chalking up gains in 58 of the past 97 years and marking a solid win rate of about 60%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Seasonax data, the index boasts an average return of 1.12% and a median return of 1.62% in the first month of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best January on record came in 1988, when the index skyrocketed 12.17%, while the worst January hit during the Great Recession in 2009, with a sharp loss of -11.41%. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite occasional setbacks, the odds have historically tilted in favor of gains as the calendar turns to the new year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Netflix's January Blockbuster: The Stock To Watch This Month</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<p>While the S&amp;P 500 delivers steady gains, <strong>Netflix Inc</strong>. (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NFLX#NASDAQ\">NFLX</a>) has a tendency to steal the spotlight in January. Over the past 20 years, the streaming giant has delivered positive returns in 15 out of 20 Januaries, boasting an average return of 12.64% and a median return of 13.47%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trigger for this stellar performance? Its fourth-quarter earnings release, typically announced in the second half of January. Netflix's fourt-quarter numbers often set the tone for the stock, and the reaction is anything but subtle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In January 2024, shares of Netflix surged by 10.7% following the release of its fourth-quarter earnings, continuing a pattern seen in previous years. Back in 2023, the stock jumped 8.46% after earnings, while in 2021, the post-earnings rally was even more dramatic, with Netflix soaring by a whopping 16.85%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Netflix&#8217;s best January on record came in 2013 when the stock soared by nearly 80%. On the other hand, the company's worst January occurred in 2022, when Netflix shares plummeted by -28.5%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For January 2025, the company will report its fourth-quarter 2024 earnings on Jan. 21. </p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Netflix's January Returns: A Two-Decade Snapshot</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Start Date</th><th>End Date</th><th>Profit %</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Jan. 3, 2005</td><td>Jan. 31, 2005</td><td>-3.52%</td></tr><tr><td>Jan. 3, 2006</td><td>Jan. 31, 2006</td><td>+5.76%</td></tr><tr><td>Jan. 3, 2007</td><td>Jan. 31, 2007</td><td>-14.28%</td></tr><tr><td>Jan. 2, 2008</td><td>Jan. 31, 2008</td><td>-4.55%</td></tr><tr><td>Jan. 2, 2009</td><td>Feb. 2, 2009</td><td>+23.70%</td></tr><tr><td>Jan. 4, 2010</td><td>Feb. 1, 2010</td><td>+14.12%</td></tr><tr><td>Jan. 3, 2011</td><td>Jan. 31, 2011</td><td>+19.99%</td></tr><tr><td>Jan. 3, 2012</td><td>Jan. 31, 2012</td><td>+66.39%</td></tr><tr><td>Jan. 2, 2013</td><td>Jan. 31, 2013</td><td>+79.59%</td></tr><tr><td>Jan. 2, 2014</td><td>Jan. 31, 2014</td><td>+12.82%</td></tr><tr><td>Jan. 2, 2015</td><td>Feb. 2, 2015</td><td>+26.40%</td></tr><tr><td>Jan. 4, 2016</td><td>Feb. 1, 2016</td><td>-14.43%</td></tr><tr><td>Jan. 3, 2017</td><td>Jan. 31, 2017</td><td>+10.37%</td></tr><tr><td>Jan. 2, 2018</td><td>Jan. 31, 2018</td><td>+34.43%</td></tr><tr><td>Jan. 2, 2019</td><td>Jan. 31, 2019</td><td>+26.84%</td></tr><tr><td>Jan. 2, 2020</td><td>Jan. 31, 2020</td><td>+4.63%</td></tr><tr><td>Jan. 4, 2021</td><td>Feb. 1, 2021</td><td>+3.09%</td></tr><tr><td>Jan. 3, 2022</td><td>Jan. 31, 2022</td><td>-28.50%</td></tr><tr><td>Jan. 3, 2023</td><td>Jan. 31, 2023</td><td>+19.97%</td></tr><tr><td>Jan. 2, 2024</td><td>Jan. 31, 2024</td><td>+20.41%</td></tr></tbody><tfoot><tr><td></td><td></td><td><strong>Average: +12.64%</strong></td></tr></tfoot></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42764418/apple-edge-ai-jpmorgans-bold-tech-predictions-for-2025\">Tech Predictions 2025: Apple&#8217;s Edge AI Drive, M&amp;A Heat, Cloud Hardware Shift</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Shutterstock</em></p>"

In today&#8217;s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market&#8217;s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let&#8217;s dive into the stock analysis:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SPY is currently trading near our pivotal level of 592.00. For bullish scenarios, buyers will aim for an initial move to 593.73. Sustained price action above 593.73 could lead to a push toward 596.57. If this level is maintained as support during regular trading hours, further upside potential exists, targeting 598.04. Our ambitious bull target for SPY today is set at 599.24.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the downside, failure to maintain 592.00 as support could see sellers testing 589.71. If downward momentum intensifies, 587.31 becomes a critical level to watch. A breakdown below this support opens the door to 585.75. In an aggressive sell-off, we anticipate SPY could reach our low bear target of 584.68.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The QQQ is hovering around the critical 517.97 level. Bulls need to assert dominance here, pushing the price higher to reclaim 519.87 as a solid support. If buyers remain consistent, a move toward 521.15 is expected. Continued strength in the auction could result in a test of 522.57, with our high bull target for the day at 523.91.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, inability to hold 517.97 during the session could shift control to the bears, leading to a retest of 516.58. Should selling pressure intensify, 515.00 and eventually 513.64 could come into play. Persistent bearish activity may drive the QQQ down to the low bear target of 511.53.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple Inc. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is currently trading near 250.39, a key level for today's session. Bulls need to maintain this level as support to pave the way for a rally to 252.13. If momentum builds, we could see further upside action toward 253.90. A sustained rally may ultimately lead to Apple reaching our high bull target of 255.16.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Failure to hold 250.39 as support could signal bearish intentions, driving the price lower to 249.04. Continued selling pressure might result in a move down to 248.12. If this level fails, 246.72 becomes the next target, with a deeper bearish session pushing Apple to the low bear target of 245.58.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Microsoft Corp. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft is trading near the 427.36 level. Bulls need to maintain this as a support area to encourage a rally to 428.48. Holding above this level could fuel further upward movement toward 429.25. Should buying momentum persist, we expect Microsoft to test the high bull target of 430.25.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the flip side, a failure at 427.36 might invite selling, leading to a drop to 426.00. Continued bearish momentum could press the price down to 425.16. If this weakness continues, we foresee a test at 423.81, with the low bear target for the day at 422.84.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NVIDIA Corporation<br></strong>NVIDIA is trading near its pivotal level of 136.98. Bulls must reclaim 137.94 as a firm support level to set the stage for a rally to 138.55. If the buying trend holds, further advances to 139.42 are possible, with our high bull target on the day at 140.28.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Failure to sustain 136.98 could bring bears into play, testing 135.64. If selling continues, the price could fall to 134.56. Persistent downside action might see NVIDIA probing 133.31, with the low bear target for the day at 132.19.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alphabet Inc Class A </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alphabet is trading near the key level of 191.45. Bulls should aim to hold this level as support and push toward 192.19. A strong bullish presence could propel the price higher to 193.14, the high bull target for today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If 191.45 fails to act as support, bears may test the downside at 190.41. A breakdown at this level could lead to 189.57. Heavy selling might result in Alphabet testing its low bear target at 188.73.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Meta Platforms Inc </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meta is trading around 591.29, a critical level for today&#8217;s auction. Bulls need to hold this level and drive the price higher to 598.17. Sustained bullish momentum could lead to further advances toward 604.50, with the high bull target set at 609.30.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should 591.29 fail to hold as support, bears may seize control, pushing the price down to 585.73. Continued sell-side activity could test 580.17. If this level breaks, Meta could reach the low bear target of 573.25.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tesla Inc. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla is trading near 407.97, an important level to watch. Bulls will aim for an initial move to 413.10. If buying interest continues, the price could rally further to 416.62. A strong session might see Tesla testing 420.70, with the high bull target set at 426.23.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If 407.97 cannot hold, bears may target 403.43. Continued selling could drive Tesla lower to 399.03. If bearish pressure persists, Tesla might reach the low bear target of 390.23.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Final Word: As the first trading session of 2025 begins, today is marked by several key events. At 8:30 AM ET, the market will digest the Initial and Continuing Jobless Claims, providing early insights into the labor market. Shortly after, at 9:45 AM ET, the release of the Final S&amp;P Global Manufacturing PMI for December will offer a snapshot of economic health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Midday, at 11:30 AM ET, the Treasury&#8217;s 4 and 8 week Bill Auction could impact short-term yields.

All these sectors are interconnected in today&#8217;s global economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, <a href=\"https://www.usglobaletfs.com/app/uploads/2024/12/WAR-Factsheet.pdf\">28%</a> of the ETF's technology sector exposure will consist of semiconductor stocks. This is important as the chip industry has been in the spotlight for a while now for its lucrative outlook. According to a recent <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/technology/state-of-the-semicon-industry.html\">PwC report</a>, global semiconductor revenues are anticipated to grow \"more than twice as fast as global GDP, reaching over $1 trillion by 2030.\" Thus, a larger exposure in this area makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, another 28% of the fund's overall holdings will go to Cybersecurity, an area that needs intense R&amp;D and consistent advancements to tackle the growing sophistication of global cybercrimes, including cyberespionage, a major headache for governments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stocks included in this actively managed fund will be chosen subject to some quantitative and fundamental parameters. Also, there is a possibility for the fund to invest in foreign companies and emerging markets. The fund prospectus currently states that its exposure to companies in the U.S. is 83%, U.K. is 7%, Germany is 7%, France 3% and Norway 3%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ETF issuer has a note of warning to investors in its press release: \"The fund's concentration in the securities of a particular industry namely Aerospace and Defense, Cybersecurity and Semi-conductor industries as well as geographic concentration may cause it to be more susceptible to greater fluctuations in share price and volatility due to adverse events that affect the Fund's investments.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, the defense industry presents a significant investment opportunity due to various global factors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, tensions with China and heightened military spending especially in Europe due to the almost doubling of arms imports between 2019 and 2023 will require high levels of defense spending. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Advanced technologies in warfare are transforming war; countries are heavily investing in AI, hypersonic missiles, and autonomous weapons, with the example being China. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As detailed by U.S. Global ETFs, cyber threats are also rising, with a 75% increase in global cyberattacks and leading to high investments in cyber security infrastructure. Bipartisan U.S. defense spending and increases in NATO military spending add weight to the potential growth of this sector. Another reason for European defense system modernization and the reduction of U.S. reliance on their systems is to grow more independent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong><br> \u2022 <strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/content/42720025/these-3-quirky-etfs-may-be-strong-plays-in-2025\">These 3 Quirky ETFs May Be Strong Plays in 2025</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Courtesy General Dynamics</em></p>"

Taken together, the analyst noted that EPS growth will be under pressure in 2025, and the stock typically tracks EPS growth. He noted an opportunity to become more positive into 2026, as the path to 10%+ revenue growth and 20%+ EPS growth comes back into focus if Check Point successfully converts incremental investments into incremental revenue growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Borges compared Check Point to Software companies with less than 10% revenue growth and enough EPS to be valued using a P/E methodology. Relative to this peer group (median 2025 P/E of 17x), Check Point offers similar revenue growth (6% on Street estimates versus 6% for peers in 2025) but better Rule of 40 (~47 versus 35). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analyst also used the S&amp;P 500 as a point of comparison: The S&amp;P 500 is trading at 22x 2025 EPS while offering ~10% EPS growth; relative to the S&amp;P 500, Check Point provides similar cross-cycle earnings growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Borges revised 2024, 2025, and 2026 EPS from $9.10, $9.75, and $10.95 to $9.10, $9.45, and $10.65 to reflect an operating expenditure trend consistent with recent history and introduced 2027 EPS of $12.25.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"750\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/02125002/newplot-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-715755\" srcset=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/02125002/newplot-1.png 750w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/02125002/newplot-1-300x260.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price Actions:</strong> NET stock is up 4.59% at $112.62 at last check Thursday.

The fourth test was \"more impressive\" without the need for any interventions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there were no interventions needed, Stein won't recommend FSD use. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analyst said the 15-mile round-trip test required no touching of the pedals or steering wheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"FSD navigated around a double-parked car, and changed lanes on the highway logically.

The vehicle also lingered to the edge of its lane, coming closer to barrier walls than many drivers would prefer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The imperfections increasingly seem to be related to sensors, not AI, which is a problem for TSLA.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stein said AI problems could be overcome quickly. Potential sensor issues could be more problematic, the analyst said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No interventions needed in the 15-mile loop is called \"impressive\" by Stein. The analyst said Tesla \"may eventually \u2018solve' autonomy.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"It's just not ready for prime time (let alone a robotaxi service) yet.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TSLA Price Action: </strong>Tesla stock is down 6.66% to $376.78 on Thursday versus a 52-week trading range of $138.80 to $488.54.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/movers/25/01/42766117/tesla-stock-tumbles-on-q4-deliveries-whats-going-on\">Tesla Stock Tumbles On Q4 Deliveries: What&#8217;s Going On?</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Jose Gil on Shutterstock</em></p>"

        "content": "<p><strong>Fubotv Inc&nbsp;</strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/FUBO#NYSE\">FUBO</a>) shares are moving higher Thursday. After becoming oversold, the recent downtrend may have ended. A new uptrend may be forming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our team of technical analysts has made it our <strong>Stock of the Day.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The term oversold refers to a stock's momentum. Momentum is a measurement of the distance it has moved between time period A and time period B.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are dozens if not hundreds of ways to measure momentum. These are called momentum indicators or oscillators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many new traders put a large number of these indicators on their charts. They think that more is better and they will have a good chance of identifying low-risk trading ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it may make sense to only use two or three of these indicators, master them and learn their nuances. For example, the lower part of the chart is the Relative Strength Index (RSI) momentum indicator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indicators usually have default settings. The default of the RSI is to measure the amount a stock has moved over 14 time periods.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1489\" height=\"816\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/02140305/1-1024x561.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-715876\" srcset=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/02140305/1-1024x561.png 1024w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/02140305/1-300x164.png 300w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/02140305/1-768x421.png 768w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/02140305/1.png 1489w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1489px) 100vw, 1489px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/24/12/42668117/spanish-language-showdown-fubotv-battles-televisaunivision-for-fair-pricing\">Fubotv Battles TelevisaUnivision for Fair Pricing In Spanish-Language Showdown</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between time period A and time period B, 14 days later, a stock may make a huge move up or down and then reverse and end up at the same price the measurement started at. Because RSI measures the difference between the prices between A and B, it will not account for these large movements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means the indicator may show a stock's momentum to be neutral when it is actually overbought or oversold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>RSI also has thresholds to identify overbought or oversold conditions. The default threshold for being overbought is exceeding the 70 level on the right side of the chart. The default setting for being oversold is when RSI drops to 30 or below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, the default settings can provide accurate signals. But sometimes traders can use different settings to obtain better results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see on the chart, when the RSI for Fubotv drops to 35, it is oversold. Since May each time this happened was a good time to buy. The RSI never reached 30. If a trader used the default settings, they would have missed these trades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;personality&#8221; of Fubotv is to be oversold when RSI reaches 35.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of using a large number of momentum indicators, a trader may have better results if they only use a few and learn their nuances. The chart of <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/FUBO\">Fubotv</a> is a good illustration of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong> <br>    \u2022 <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/25/01/42758021/roaring-kitty-keith-gill-sparks-speculation-with-rick-james-themed-post-on-x-gamestop-chewy-shares-in-focus\">&#8216;Roaring Kitty&#8217; Keith Gill Sparks Speculation With Rick James-Themed Post On X: GameStop, Chewy Shares In Focus \u2014 Unity Software Pops 12%</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Courtesy of FuboTv.</em></p>"

For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of Cango, which is trading at $5.06 as of publishing time, $100 would buy you 19.76 shares of stock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to \u2018go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock\">stock can be found at this resource.</a> Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading &#8211; either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/25/01/42771235/spotify-empowers-creators-with-new-partner-program-whats-on-the-cards\">Spotify Empowers Creators With New Partner Program &#8211; What&#8217;s On The Cards?</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CANG Price Action</strong>: At the time of writing, Cango stock is trading 14.8% higher at $5.05, according to data from <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/pro/\">Benzinga Pro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Image via Shutterstock</em></p>    "

Apple will also offer discounts of 200 to 300 yuan on older iPhone models and other device categories. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related Link: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42764418/apple-edge-ai-jpmorgans-bold-tech-predictions-for-2025\">Tech Predictions 2025: Apple&#8217;s Edge AI Drive, M&amp;A Heat, Cloud Hardware Shift</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is reportedly battling market share declines as local competition intensifies in China, which is the world&#8217;s biggest smartphone market. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chinese tech giant <strong>Huawei</strong> is one of the companies taking share from Apple in the region since it launched a premium challenger in August 2023. Huawei also reportedly slashed prices on phones and other high-end tech devices by as much as 3,000 yuan this past weekend. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple&#8217;s China sales fell 0.3% year-over-year in the third quarter, while Huawei sales jumped 42%, the report states, citing research firm IDC. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>UBS analysts <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42760822/ubs-cuts-iphone-sales-forecast-for-december-as-apple-faces-stiff-competition-from-other-players\">lowered their iPhone sales outlook</a> for December on Thursday due to declining market share in China. The firm maintained a Neutral rating and price target of $236 after cutting revenue estimates for the quarter by about 2%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The selloff in Apple shares on Thursday may also be partly due to profit taking given that the stock rallied roughly 35% to all-time highs in 2024. Some investors may have been waiting until January to take profits for tax purposes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AAPL Price Action:</strong> <a href=\"http://benzinga.com/quote/aapl\">Apple shares</a> were down 3.13% at $242.55 at the time of publication Thursday, according to <a href=\"http://pro.benzinga.com\">Benzinga Pro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: courtesy of Apple.</em></p>"

In 2000, after five years of internet frenzy, the market crashed.&nbsp; Those who were primarily invested in speculative stocks lost 90% &#8211; 95% of the value of their portfolios.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>As the market enters 2025, the AI frenzy has been going for only two years versus five years of internet frenzy before the market crashed in 2000.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>With extreme hopium, here is the mantra the stock market is following for 2025:\n<ul>\n<li>Trump will fix everything.&nbsp; At The Arora Report, we would like nothing more than to see Trump succeed.&nbsp; However, the market may face a rude awakening when hopium meets reality.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>As a Magic 8 Ball solution, the market believes bitcoin is the solution to budget deficits, $36T of national debt, and maintaining the dollar as the world's reserve currency.&nbsp; Trump is apparently planning a one million bitcoin U.S. strategic reserve.&nbsp; The biggest U.S. based bitcoin whale is advocating for a six to seven million bitcoin reserve.&nbsp; In The Arora Report analysis, while it is not impossible for bitcoin to fix these issues, the probability of it working out the way bitcoin bulls are promoting is low.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The stock market is believing that the AI frenzy will continue for a third year, taking the stock market to new highs.&nbsp; In The Arora Report analysis, AI will become smarter and more pervasive in 2025, leading to large productivity gains.&nbsp; However, AI will also be disruptive.&nbsp; Even though the stock market thinks there will only be winners from AI, the reality is there will also be many losers.&nbsp; Further in The Arora Report analysis, money will flow out of some of the present day AI favorites to more software companies and other companies that are users of AI.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Quantum computing is the latest buzz word that is spreading like wildfire.&nbsp; In The Arora Report analysis, quantum computing has the potential to be bigger than the internet and AI.&nbsp; The emphasis here is on the word \"potential.\" &nbsp; Further in The Arora Report analysis, know-nothing pumpers are in fantasy land regarding quantum computing.&nbsp; Although there are significant advances in the science, reality is nowhere near the fantasy that is spreading like wildfire.&nbsp; Expect many in the momo crowd to become bag holders.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The stock market is hoping that the Fed will continue to cut rates under pressure from Trump even when the data may not support rate cuts.&nbsp; In The Arora Report analysis, in 2018 in the face of opposition from Trump, Powell did not have the spine to continue with rate cuts and he reversed.&nbsp; Market hopium regarding the Fed may work, unless inflation heats up.&nbsp; In The Arora Report analysis, there is better than 50% probability of inflation heating up depending upon how Trump executes his policies.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Initial jobless claims came at 211K vs. 224K consensus.&nbsp; This indicates that the jobs picture remains strong, especially at the low end.&nbsp; If the data continues this strong, the Fed will have difficulty cutting rates further.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>As of this writing, some of the extreme optimism from early this morning is dissipating on the data that <strong>Tesla Inc</strong> deliveries came at 495K vs. 504K consensus. \u00a0 TSLA stock has been a major gainer after Trump&#8217;s re-election.\u00a0 As full disclosure, TSLA is in The Arora Report&#8217;s ZYX Buy Core Model Portfolio.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Europe</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>After 57 years, Russian gas has stopped flowing to Europe through Ukraine.&nbsp; Natural gas prices are rising.&nbsp; Two beneficiaries of rising natural gas prices in The Arora Report&#8217;s ZYX Buy Core Model Portfolio are <strong>Shell PLC</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SHEL#NYSE\">SHEL</a>) and <strong>EOG Resources Inc</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/EOG#NYSE\">EOG</a>).&nbsp; Other stocks benefiting from rising natural gas prices are <strong>Expand Energy Corp</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/EXE#NASDAQ\">EXE</a>), <strong>EQT Corp</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/EQT#NYSE\">EQT</a>), and <strong>Range Resources Corp</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/RRC#NYSE\">RRC</a>) \u2013 as full disclosure, these stocks are in the portfolio that surrounds The Arora Report&#8217;s Model Portfolio in ZYX Buy.&nbsp; As full disclosure, natural gas stock <strong>Devon Energy Corp</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/DVN#NYSE\">DVN</a>) is in the January Effect list.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>China</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Chinese stocks have started the new year on a sour note on concerns about Trump tariffs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Magnificent Seven Money Flows</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In the early trade, money flows are positive in <strong>Amazon.com, Inc.</strong>, <strong>Alphabet Inc Class C</strong> , <strong>Meta Platforms Inc</strong>, <strong>Microsoft Corp</strong>, <strong>NVIDIA Corp</strong>, and TSLA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the early trade, money flows are negative in <strong>Apple Inc </strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the early trade, money flows are positive in S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) and <strong>Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Momo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Investors can gain an edge by knowing money flows in SPY and QQQ.\u00a0 Investors can get a bigger edge by knowing when smart money is buying stocks, gold, and oil.\u00a0 The most popular ETF for gold is <strong>SPDR Gold Trust</strong>.\u00a0 The most popular ETF for silver is <strong>iShares Silver Trust</strong>.\u00a0 The most popular ETF for oil is <strong>United States Oil ETF</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bitcoin</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bitcoin</strong> is seeing buying.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Protection Band And What To Do Now</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.&nbsp; The proprietary protection band from The Arora Report is very popular.&nbsp; The protection band puts all of the data, all of the indicators, all of the news, all of the crosscurrents, all of the models, and all of the analysis in an analytical framework that is easily actionable by investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.&nbsp; The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.&nbsp; If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash.&nbsp; A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.&nbsp; </strong>When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp; High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Traditional 60/40 Portfolio</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.&nbsp; Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the big artificial intelligence rally before anyone else, the new bull market of 2023, the bear market of 2022, new stock market highs right after the virus low in 2020, the virus drop in 2020, the DJIA rally to 30,000 when it was trading at 16,000, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, and the financial crash of 2008.

The IRS subsequently issued <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-25-07.pdf\">Notice 2025-7</a> to provide temporary transition relief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cryptocurrency holders are no longer locked into the FIFO method but can document tax liabilities using their own books, records or crypto tax software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The temporary relief affects sales on centralized exchanges in the calendar year 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following this period, users will have to select an accounting method for assets held on CeFi platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shehan advised his followers, &#8220;Make sure to pick your accounting method at your CeFi exchange on 1/1/26. If you don&#8217;t pick one, you will most likely default to FIFO.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This relief is automatically applied and doesn&#8217;t require any specific action from taxpayers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-crypto-tax-software\">Best Crypto Tax Software in 2024</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Shehan emphasizes the importance of using reputable crypto tax software or maintaining reliable records for those who wish to sell CeFi assets under methods other than FIFO during 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The temporary relief aims to provide crypto holders with more flexibility and potentially better tax outcomes during the transition period, especially in a bull market environment where FIFO could lead to higher capital gains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/cryptocurrency-tax-guide\">Beginner's Guide: How to File Crypto Taxes in 2024</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>"

The sector has recently seen increased interest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stock&#8217;s upward momentum, gaining some 190% over the trailing month, may also be attributed to the company&#8217;s December announcement of <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/24/12/42533581/quantum-computing-stock-is-rising-tuesday-heres-why\">securing a prime contract</a> with <strong>NASA</strong> to leverage <strong>Dirac-3</strong> for advanced imaging and data processing support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What To Know:</strong> The contract, awarded by NASA&#8217;s <strong>Goddard Space Flight Center</strong>, involves using Quantum Computing's entropy quantum optimization machine, Dirac-3, to tackle advanced imaging challenges. The technology is expected to provide innovative solutions in the realm of quantum computing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/25/01/42768870/whats-going-on-with-rigetti-computing-rgti-stock\">What&#8217;s Going On With Rigetti Computing Stock?</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company says Dirac-3 will address a complex phase unwrapping issue for reconstructing images and extracting radar-generated interferometric data, aiming to enhance data quality and accuracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CEO William McGann</strong> meanwhile expressed pride in supporting NASA's mission. The project will compare Dirac-3's quantum optimization capabilities with classical algorithms, potentially demonstrating the tangible advantages of quantum approaches in data processing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/movers/25/01/42766117/tesla-stock-tumbles-on-q4-deliveries-whats-going-on\">Tesla Stock Tumbles On Q4 Deliveries: What&#8217;s Going On?</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How To Buy QUBT Stock</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides going to a brokerage platform to purchase a share &#8211; or fractional share &#8211; of stock, you can also gain access to shares either by buying an exchange traded fund (ETF) that holds the stock itself, or by allocating yourself to a strategy in your 401(k) that would seek to acquire shares in a mutual fund or other instrument. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in Quantum Computing&#8217;s case, it is in the Information Technology sector. An ETF will likely hold shares in many liquid and large companies that help track that sector, allowing an investor to gain exposure to the trends within that segment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to data from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/register174\">Benzinga Pro</a>, QUBT has a 52-week high of $27.15 and a 52-week low of $0.35.</p>"

        "content": "<p>It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that semiconductor giant <strong>Intel Corp</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/INTC#NASDAQ\">INTC</a>) <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/media/25/01/42762874/broadcom-thrives-with-114-stock-surge-in-ai-boom-while-intel-faces-steep-decline\">is hurting</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past 52 weeks, Intel slipped approximately 58%. A range of woes, from management miscues to brewing skepticism of its competitive viability, have clouded the once-proud tech juggernaut. However, it's also possible that \u2014 at least in the near term \u2014 the ugliness could already be baked in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In early December, Intel's board <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/12/42275410/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-forced-out-by-board-analysts-cheer-potential-strategy-shift-this-move-opens-the-door\">reportedly forced out</a> CEO <strong>Pat Gelsinger</strong>, which wasn't the most surprising development. While the chipmaker took significant steps \u2014 including a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/24/08/40340162/intels-turnaround-strategy-will-job-cuts-spark-tesla-like-stock-rally\">dramatic workforce reduction</a> \u2014 to right the ship, the company's fiduciaries grew frustrated with Gelsinger's turnaround progress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the business week ending Dec. 6, Intel stock fell 15.78% \u2014 a reflection of deep uncertainty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last August, Intel stock suffered a seismic decline due to the semiconductor firm posting <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/INTC/earnings\">earnings per share of 2 cents</a> for the second quarter, against an estimated print of 10 cents. Additionally, some analysts fretted over Intel's <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/11/41691058/intel-struggles-with-market-share-profitability-q3-analyst-insights\">market share loss to the competition</a>. \u00a0At the same time, this bad news is now in the rearview mirror. Looking forward, the contrarian bulls may sense a deep-value proposition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Technical and Statistical Trends May Favor Upside for Intel Stock</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key factors shining a bullish light on Intel stock is the discipline of <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/what-you-need-to-know-about-technical-analysis\">technical analysis</a> or using price movements to identify buy and sell signals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, since the aforementioned August earnings fallout, Intel has printed a series of rising lows. Previously, the bulls managed to hold support at $19. At the moment, the optimists have dug themselves in at the $20 level.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"593\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/02143213/INTC-stock-01022025-1024x593.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-715909\" srcset=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/02143213/INTC-stock-01022025-1024x593.jpg 1024w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/02143213/INTC-stock-01022025-300x174.jpg 300w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/02143213/INTC-stock-01022025-768x445.jpg 768w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/02143213/INTC-stock-01022025.jpg 1032w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This trend implies that investors are now attuned to any positive news. In other words, Intel has already suffered layoffs, leadership challenges and competitive headwinds, among many other concerns. Again, the dirty laundry has already been seen and accounted for. All it may take now is a modicum of positivity to spark a quick recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another element that might favor the upside for Intel stock is its statistical trend. Relatively speaking, large weekly drops in security are rare. Not including sessions from last month, in the past five years, there have only been eight weeks where Intel stock dropped 10% or more. Of this figure, only three instances saw Intel deliver a positive return by the end of the fourth subsequent week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put another way, investors generally steer clear of the chipmaker when it suffers badly over a one-week period. However, since the early December drop, Intel stock appears to have found its footing at the $20 support line. For intrepid speculators, this might be the signal to pull the trigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Laying The Groundwork For A Bull Call Spread</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An enticing mechanism by which to speculate on INTC stock is an options strategy called the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/bull-spread\">bull call spread</a>. This approach calls for buying a call option and simultaneously selling a call at a higher strike price for the same expiration date. The idea is to use the credit received from the short call to partially offset the debit paid for the long call, thus discounting a net bullish position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conservative investors may want to consider the 18/20 bull call spread (buy the $18 call, sell the $20 call) for the options chain expiring Jan. 24, 2025. Fundamentally, the expiration date comes one day after Intel posts its Q4 earnings results. Should good news arrive, INTC stock will likely shoot higher. Investors can also close the position early, under the thesis of buy the rumor, sell the news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in a bull call spread, a security moving significantly above the short strike price represents an opportunity cost as the maximum reward is capped at that particular price. For a more aggressive approach, investors may consider the 20/22 bull call spread for the Jan. 24 expiration date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, the maximum reward can be collected if INTC stock rises to $22 or above by expiration. Further, the $22 price point roughly splits the current support level and the prior support of approximately $25 which materialized in late 2022 and early 2023, making it a logical target.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Now Read:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/regulations/25/01/42772746/tiktok-set-for-a-ban-on-jan-19-by-law-but-trump-has-other-plans\">TikTok Set For A Ban on Jan 19 By Law, But Trump Has Other Plans</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>"

Coupled with the official PMI of 50.1, the data underscores waning domestic and export demand. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This slowdown pressures Bilibili, which relies heavily on consumer engagement and discretionary spending to drive revenue from advertising, subscriptions and virtual gifts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Geopolitical tensions further complicate matters, as U.S. semiconductor embargoes and potential tariffs cast a shadow over China's tech sector.

You can find a list of <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-stock-trading-platforms\">possible trading platforms here.</a> Many will allow you to buy \u2018fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the the case of Bilibili, which is trading at $17.07 as of publishing time, $100 would buy you 5.86 shares of stock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to \u2018go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock\">stock can be found at this resource.</a> Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading &#8211; either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to data from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/register174\">Benzinga Pro</a>, BILI has a 52-week high of $31.77 and a 52-week low of $8.80.</p>"

The arguments in today's report are intentionally misleading and inaccurate and have already been made numerous times by other short sellers seeking to benefit from a decline in our stock price. We plan to stay focused on executing our plan for another great year in 2025,&#8221; a Carvana spokesperson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Check This Out: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/movers/25/01/42766117/tesla-stock-tumbles-on-q4-deliveries-whats-going-on#google_vignette\">Tesla Stock Tumbles On Q4 Deliveries: What&#8217;s Going On?</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://benzinga.com/quote/cvna\">Carvana shares</a> fell about 5% when the report was released, but quickly bounced back. The stock was up more than 3% at last check, according to <a href=\"http://pro.benzinga.com\">Benzinga Pro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hindenburg claimed its research uncovered &#8220;accounting manipulation and lax underwriting&#8221; that have &#8220;fueled temporary reported income growth.&#8221; The short seller said it also found $800 million in loan sales to a &#8220;suspected undisclosed related party.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hindenburg went on to highlight recent insider selling, suggesting the company&#8217;s share price is inflated. All findings aside, the short seller believes the stock is &#8220;exorbitantly valued,&#8221; trading with a 845% higher sales multiple than competitors <strong>CarMax</strong> and <strong>AutoNation</strong>, and a 754% higher forward earnings multiple. Carvana currently has a forward price-to-earnings multiple of approximately 101, according to <a href=\"http://pro.benzinga.com\">Benzinga Pro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CVNA Price Action: </strong>Carvana shares were up 3.37% at $210.20 at the time of publication Thursday, according to <a href=\"http://pro.benzinga.com\">Benzinga Pro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Shutterstock.</em></p>"

That's the highest level in over a year, driven by concerns about rising inflation and shifting monetary policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Federal Reserve, which delivered a 25-basis-point interest rate cut in December, sounded hawkish in its accompanying guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Officials signaled fewer rate cuts in 2025 than markets had expected and raised inflation forecasts to reflect upcoming administration policies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The&nbsp;Bond&nbsp;Vigilantes are sending a loud warning message,&#8221; said <strong>Ed Yardeni</strong>, president of Yardeni Research, in a recent note. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They aren&#8217;t convinced Donald Trump, the new sheriff coming to town, will maintain fiscal law and order any better than the old sheriff. They are also losing their confidence in <strong>Jerome Powell</strong>, the deputy in charge of monetary law and order,&#8221; he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent report, Bravos Research highlighted that&nbsp;the 10-year&nbsp;Treasury&nbsp;yield&nbsp;rocketed from 3.6% in September to 4.6% in late December, implying a 25% increase in just 100 trading sessions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Moves like this are rare and have massive implications for the stock market,&#8221; the Bravos Research Team wrote. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Trump's Policies Add To Market Jitters</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Investor anxiety over Trump's incoming administration added another layer of complexity to the bond market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump has floated the idea of scrapping the federal debt ceiling, a controversial move that could enable unchecked government borrowing and stoke inflationary pressures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such a policy would effectively remove a key restraint on federal deficits, raising alarm among bond investors already bracing for fiscal expansion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"There's now more bad reasons for the rise in yields,\" Yardeni stated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the expert highlighted, while stronger-than-expected economic data in the second half of 2024 initially pushed bond yields higher, the recent decline in the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index has shifted focus to structural concerns, such as persistent inflation risks and growing deficits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investors are also bracing for potential trade turbulence, as Trump has pledged to impose a universal 10% tariff and hike tariffs on Chinese imports to 60%. These measures, if enacted, could exacerbate inflationary pressures and add fuel to the bond market&#8217;s recent turmoil.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Treasury Department Breach Highlights New Risks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Compounding the challenges in December, the U.S. Treasury Department confirmed it was the target of a Chinese state-sponsored cyberattack. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hackers compromised a third-party vendor, BeyondTrust, and gained access to unclassified documents, according to a <a href=\"https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/25472740-letter-to-chairman-brown-and-ranking-member-scott/\">letter</a> sent to lawmakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The major breach allowed hackers to override security protocols and access Treasury workstations via a stolen key. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Treasury Department said it became aware of the attack on Dec. 8 and is working with the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to assess the damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42768507/china-slaps-export-restrictions-on-dozens-of-us-companies-boeing-lockheed-martin-general-dynamics-raytheon-affected\">China&#8217;s Export Crackdown Hits Boeing, Lockheed Martin And More</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Shutterstock</em></p>"

Analyst Lizzie Dove cites accelerating Net Purchase Intent (NPI) data and cost savings from a 2023 management shuffle. Dove expects Norwegian to widen its yield-to-unit-cost spread by 2.5 percentage points, bringing its valuation closer to peer <strong>Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/RCL#NYSE\">RCL</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analyst <strong>Eric Sheridan</strong> remains bullish on Uber despite skepticism over its mobility business and the rise of autonomous vehicles.

        "content": "<p>Las Vegas Sheriff <strong>Kevin McMahill</strong> announced Thursday that investigators now suspect the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/25/01/42757028/tesla-cybertruck-ignites-outside-trump-international-hotel-in-las-vegas\">explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck</a> outside the Trump International Hotel on New Year&#8217;s Day was likely a suicide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking at a news conference Thursday, McMahill revealed that evidence suggests the driver died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound moments before the vehicle exploded. A firearm was found at the driver's feet inside the charred vehicle, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/01/02/las-vegas-explosion-tesla-cybertruck-trump-hotel-colorado/\">according to</a> the Washington Post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Authorities are still working to confirm the driver's identity, as the body was burned beyond recognition. Preliminary evidence, they said, points to 37-year-old <strong>Matthew Livelsberger</strong> of Colorado Springs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Livelsberger was a Special Forces soldier on leave from a mission in Germany at the time of his death. He first enlisted in 2006 and had served multiple deployments, including to Afghanistan, the newspaper reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The FBI, as part of its Joint Terrorism Task Force, is investigating the case, which included searching  a Colorado Springs residence on Thursday connected to the incident, though no further details were provided. \"This activity is related to the explosion in Las Vegas,\" the FBI said in a statement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tesla </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a>) CEO <strong>Elon Musk</strong> said on <strong>X</strong> that Tesla&#8217;s senior team is involved and has shared video footage from charging stations across the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/25/01/42772041/fbi-confirms-lone-suspect-in-new-orleans-attack-vegas-probe-ongoing\">FBI Says Suspect In New Orleans Attack Acted Alone; Vegas Cybertruck Explosion Suspect Identified</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Colleagues Shocked</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Livelsberger's colleagues and former commanders expressed shock. Speaking on the condition of anonymity due to his work in the U.S. government, one soldier described Livelsberger as warm and caring, the Washington Post reported. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Livelsberger held the rank of master sergeant and was assigned to the 10th Special Forces Group based in Colorado Springs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surveillance footage and Tesla data helped authorities track the Cybertruck's journey from Colorado to Las Vegas. The vehicle, rented in Colorado, arrived at the Trump Hotel around 7:30 a.m. Wednesday. It detonated an hour later. Video shared by authorities shows the truck, loaded with firework mortars and gas canisters, erupting in a fiery explosion near the hotel's entrance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>FBI Says No Link Between Las Vegas, NOLA Attack</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the FBI addressed concerns over potential links between this incident and a separate attack in New Orleans earlier this week. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"There is no definitive link between the attack here in New Orleans and the one in Las Vegas,\" <strong>Christopher Raia</strong>, deputy assistant director of the FBI's counterterrorism division, said at a Thursday news conference on <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/media/25/01/42769136/turo-used-for-new-orleans-las-vegas-attacks-we-are-devastated-by-these-horrible-incidents\">the New Orleans attack</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Now Read:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/25/01/42772702/tesla-analyst-says-fsd-test-drive-shows-imperfections-not-ready-for-prime-time-yet\"><strong>Tesla Analyst Says FSD Test Drive Shows Imperfections, &#8216;Not Ready For Prime Time Yet&#8217;</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Shutterstock</em></p>"

That means that the same day that Collins' previous disclosed purchases began hitting the news, the Congressman was buying more of the coin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins' latest trade was once again marked as unusual by several prominent social media accounts that track congressional trading activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"BREAKING: US politician Michael Collins has yet again bought crypto.

The latest trade disclosure shows that Collins also bought more Ski Mask Dog coin on Dec. 3 ahead of the all-time highs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins, who won re-election in the 2024 election, has previously disclosed buying and selling cryptocurrencies like <strong>Ethereum </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/eth/usd\">ETH</a>), <strong>Aerodrome </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/\">AERO</a>), <strong>Velodrome </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/\">VELO</a>) and<strong> The Graph</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/\">GRT</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins' purchases of Ethereum have been larger in recent disclosures compared to the meme coin he recently bought. The congressman has also disclosed selling some of the cryptocurrencies in the past, which could make the recent meme coin buy one to watch in case he later shows he sold it after the recent gains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calls to ban members of Congress from buying stocks and options have grown, with President <strong>Joe Biden</strong> recently <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/24/12/42538504/biden-endorses-ban-of-congressional-stock-trading-nobody-in-the-congress-should-be-able-to-make-money-in-the-stock-market-while-in-office\">endorsing a ban </a>on Congress trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to members of Congress buying and selling cryptocurrencies, there is less support and it is less mentioned in potential legislation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Nobody in the Congress should be able to make money in the stock market while they&#8217;re in the Congress,&#8221; Biden said, failing to mention cryptocurrency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Members of Congress are currently allowed to buy and sell stocks, options, cryptocurrency and make other investments as long as they are disclosed in 45 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collins' trade, which happened nearly 30 days ago and came as his past trade in the same coin may have led to the price soaring could spark interest in putting the same ban on cryptocurrency. With pro-crypto President-elect<strong> Donald Trump </strong>taking office later this month, more members of Congress could be looking to add cryptocurrency to their investment portfolios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ski Mask Dog, which began trading in 2024, is up 6% in the past day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The meme cryptocurrency currently trades at $0.2246 at the time of writing Thursday, versus a one-month range of $0.1472 to $0.3639.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/politics/24/01/36459015/10-best-stock-traders-in-congress-in-2023-spoiler-nancy-pelosi-is-back-on-the-list\">10 Best Stock Traders In Congress In 2023 (Spoiler: Nancy Pelosi Has Reentered The Chat)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: SMRM1977 via Shutterstock</em></p>    "

OpenAI countered recently by saying Musk wanted a for-profit structure for the company in 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The billionaire's lawsuit was first filed in early 2023 related to OpenAI's partnership with <strong>Microsoft Corp. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ\">MSFT</a>), which he alleged broke the company's nonprofit commitment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Altman <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/24/12/42609769/elon-musk-is-a-legendary-entrepreneur-but-also-a-bully-says-openai-ceo-sam-altman-now-its-me-its-been-bezos-gates-zuckerberg-lots-of-other-people\">recently showed appreciation</a> for what Musk did to help support OpenAI \"in the early days,\" but shared new criticism of the billionaire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"He's also clearly a bully and he's also someone who clearly likes to get in fights. Now it's me, it's been Bezos, Gates, Zuckerberg lots of other people,\" Altman said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the battle against OpenAI, Musk has now gained recent support from <strong>Meta Platforms Inc </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/META#NASDAQ\">META</a>) and the &#8220;Godfather of AI,&#8221; which could make the fight against Altman and OpenAI a must-watch story in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/06/39319028/terminator-in-real-life-ai-godfather-warns-of-human-wipe-out-in-5-to-20-years\">Terminator In Real Life?

He argued that the program&#8217;s main function is not to hire top talent, as Musk suggests, but to replace well-paying American jobs with low-wage foreign workers.

He cited Census Bureau data to say that millions of Americans with advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering and math are currently not working in related professions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giving the specific example of Musk&#8217;s <strong>Tesla Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a>), Sanders asked if H1-B jobs are going to the &#8220;best and brightest&#8221; and why Tesla has employed guest workers as associate accountants for as little as $58,000 and associate mechanical engineers for as little as $70,000 a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If there is really a shortage of skilled tech workers in America, why did Tesla lay-off over 7,500 American workers this year,&#8221; asked Sanders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sanders said that the H1-B visa program should only be utilized as a &#8220;very short-term and temporary approach.&#8221; In his statement he also supporter raising the minimum wage for guest workers and allowing them to easily switch jobs. He advocated that corporations be required to aggressively recruit American workers before they can hire from overseas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla did not immediately respond to <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard\">Benzinga&#8217;s</a> request for comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/25/01/42778468/congressman-buys-more-ski-mask-dog-coin-will-meme-coin-hit-new-all-time-highs-on-latest-disclosure?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Congressman Buys More Ski Mask Dog Coin: Will Meme Coin Hit New All-Time-Highs On Latest Disclosure?</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: Musk&#8217;s support for the H-1B visa program aligns with President-elect <strong>Donald Trump&#8217;s</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/12/42715951/trump-backs-immigration-visas-musk-praises-his-stance-and-says-rising-tide-lifts-all-boats\">backing of the initiative. </a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I&#8217;ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times.

This recommendation comes as consumption remains subdued and market volatility is anticipated to increase due to impending higher tariffs by US President-elect&nbsp;<strong>Donald Trump</strong>, Bloomberg&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-03/ubs-wealth-urges-chinese-stock-investors-to-stay-defensive?ref=biztoc.com\">reported</a> on Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an interview with Bloomberg Television,&nbsp;<strong>Eva Lee</strong>,&nbsp;head of Greater China equities&nbsp;at UBS, suggested that investors focus on stocks offering dividend yields above 6%, significantly higher than the 2% government yields.

The&nbsp;<strong>CSI 300 Index</strong>&nbsp;continued its downward trend on Friday. Although last year&#8217;s stimulus measures have helped stabilize the market, traders are wary of economic uncertainties as Trump&#8217;s inauguration approaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>China plans to&nbsp;issue more ultra-long special treasury&nbsp;bonds in 2025 to support&nbsp;consumer product trade-in programs&nbsp;and major projects. Meanwhile, the&nbsp;10-year government bond yield fell below 1.6% on Friday, reflecting&nbsp;economic concerns and expectations for&nbsp;further monetary easing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The advice follows Chinese stocks experiencing a drop right after resuming trading after New Year&#8217;s Day. The drop was attributed to a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/regulations/25/01/42767647/chinese-stocks-drop-as-manufacturing-growth-slows-and-geopolitical-tensions-hit\">slowdown in manufacturing growth</a>. The Caixin/S&amp;P Global manufacturing purchasing managers&#8217; index for December fell to 50.5, missing analyst expectations. This slowdown is compounded by geopolitical tensions, including a semiconductor embargo from the U.S. and concerns over potential tariffs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the Trump administration plans to <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/regulations/24/12/42701155/made-in-china-paid-in-america-what-trumps-new-tariffs-mean-for-the-us-economy\">significantly increase tariffs </a>on Chinese imports, with rates potentially rising by 20 percentage points.

        "content": "<p>U.S. new-car sales are forecasted to reach a significant milestone in 2024, with projections indicating a five-year high. Analysts attribute this surge to improved inventories and increased incentives. The projection comes ahead of automakers reporting their final sales tallies throughout the day on Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: According to&nbsp;Reuters,&nbsp;U.S. new-car sales in 2024&nbsp;are projected to exceed 15.8 million units, marking the highest level since 2019. This increase is attributed to improved&nbsp;inventories and higher incentives, analysts&nbsp;noted on Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>General Motors Co.</strong>&nbsp;(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GM#NYSE\">GM</a>) is expected to maintain its position as the top seller, with sales nearing 2.7 million vehicles, according to Cox Automotive analysts. The strong sales performance is supported by what GM&#8217;s CFO <strong>Paul Jacobson </strong>described as a &#8220;remarkably&#8221; resilient consumer base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While most major automakers experienced a positive year,\u00a0<strong>Stellantis N.V.</strong>\u00a0(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/STLA#NYSE\">STLA</a>) and\u00a0<strong>Tesla Inc.</strong>\u00a0(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a>) did not achieve year-over-year sales growth. Stellantis faced challenges with declining sales in its Ram, Jeep, and Dodge brands, partly due to\u00a0an aggressive pricing strategy that\u00a0led to CEO <strong>Carlos Tavares</strong>&#8216; departure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/24/12/42735744/pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-predicts-doom-for-michael-saylors-microstrategy-as-stock-dips-below-300-in-after-hours-trading?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8216;Pharma Bro&#8217; Martin Shkreli Predicts Liquidation Doom For MicroStrategy Amid Fall Below $300, Says Bitcoin Will Hit $250K Without Michael Saylor</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Electric vehicle sales in the U.S. are anticipated to reach 1.3 million, accounting for about 8% of total new vehicle sales. This marks a slight increase from 2023, as consumers rushed to benefit from EV tax credits before potential changes under President-elect <strong>Donald Trump</strong>&#8216;s administration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.D. Power reported increased vehicle discounts, with average incentives per vehicle expected to rise&nbsp;30.7% from December 2023 to&nbsp;December 2024. Analysts predict that these trends will continue into 2025, sustaining sales momentum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The anticipated rise in U.S. new-car sales comes amid significant changes in the automotive industry. According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42762224/bev-market-share-will-increase-across-us-china-europe-in-2025-says-sp-global-mobility\">S&amp;P Global Mobility</a>, battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales are expected to grow by 30% in 2025, capturing 17% of the global light vehicle market. In the U.S., BEVs are projected to account for 11.2% of light vehicle sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally,&nbsp;President-elect <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/regulations/24/12/42688941/are-us-vehicles-under-30000-a-thing-of-the-past-trumps-mexico-tariff-plans-could-change-auto-market\">Trump&#8217;s proposed tariffs</a>&nbsp;on automobiles imported from Mexico could impact vehicle pricing, potentially affecting the availability of sub-$30,000 cars in the U.S. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/12/42737402/bernie-sanders-supports-trumps-credit-card-interest-rate-cap-at-10-amid-highest-defaults-since-2008-visa-and-mastercard-trade-in-the-red?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bernie Sanders Calls Trump&#8217;s 10% Interest Rate Cap On Credit Card Debt A &#8216;Great Idea&#8217; As Defaults Surge To Highest Levels Since 2008: Visa, Mastercard Stocks Fall In Premarket</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Disclaimer</em></strong><em>: This content was partially produced with the help of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/author/benzinga-neuro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Benzinga Neuro</a>&nbsp;and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo courtesy: Shutterstock</em></p>"

        "content": "<p><strong>KoBold Metals</strong>, the AI-driven mining startup backed by <strong>Bill Gates</strong> and <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong>, has secured $537 million in its Series C funding round. The latest funding round gives the Berkeley-based company a valuation of $2.96 billion and fresh capital to pursue ambitious goals in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/commodities\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">critical minerals sector</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Durable Capital Partners LP</strong> and <strong>T. Rowe Price</strong> funds led the round, alongside contributions from existing investors such as <strong>Andreessen Horowitz Growth</strong>, <strong>Breakthrough Energy Ventures</strong>, and <strong>Mitsubishi Corporation</strong>, as well as new players like <strong>StepStone Group</strong> and <strong>WCM Investment Management</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This latest injection brings KoBold's total fundraising to $1 billion. The funds will accelerate exploration, develop high-potential projects, and enhance its R&amp;D capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>KoBold's innovative approach relies on artificial intelligence to locate deposits of vital minerals such as copper, cobalt, lithium, and nickel. The company's proprietary technology aggregates data from sources like satellite imagery and historical drilling reports to create a detailed \"Google Maps\" of the Earth's crust, pinpointing untapped resources that traditional methods might miss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using this technology, KoBold discovered a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/02/36940360/kobold-metals-announces-historic-copper-discovery-in-zambia\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">substantial copper deposit</a> in Zambia's Copperbelt. The <strong>Dumbwa </strong>target, part of the <strong>Solwezi</strong> project, exhibited promising results, including drilling highlights of 16 meters at 1.24% copper. KoBold's $2 billion <strong>Mingomba</strong> site is set to produce at least 300,000 tons annually by 2030, making it Zambia's largest copper operation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"About 40% of the new capital will go toward advancing existing projects into production, with Zambia receiving the lion's share,\" KoBold's CEO and co-founder <strong>Kurt House</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.koboldmetals.com/news/mining-startup-kobold-metals-valued-at-2-96-bn-after-closing-537m-series-c/?aid=01\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">said</a> to the Financial Times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 60 active projects across continents, including partnerships with mining giants like <strong>BHP</strong> and <strong>Rio Tinto</strong>, the firm is ready to reshuffle the industry. House noted they plan to aggressively expand the team, particularly seeking data scientists, while expanding into new jurisdictions such as Finland and Botswana. The company also aims to go public within three to five years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite changes in U.S. political leadership, House expressed confidence in bipartisan support for critical mineral initiatives. \"There is very broad bipartisan support for diversifying [the] supply of critical minerals because this is a national security priority,\" he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>U.S. foreign policy is aiding companies like KoBold. President <strong>Joe Biden's</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/emerging-markets/24/10/41416913/bidens-farewell-to-africa-strategic-motives-behind-first-and-only-presidential-visit\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">last official trip</a> to Angola discussed revitalizing the <strong>Lobito</strong> railway line to facilitate mineral transport across Angola, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Thus, firms like KoBold would benefit from better infrastructure while bolstering Western access to strategic resources and reducing reliance on China-dominated supply chains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/commodities/25/01/42759408/gold-prices-to-climb-7-in-2025-amid-trumps-return-to-white-house-and-geopolitical-tensions-momentum-is-taking-back-over\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gold Prices To Climb 7% In 2025 Amid Trump's Return To White House And Geopolitical Tensions: \u2018Momentum Is Taking Back Over'</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo via via Shutterstock</em></p>"

Meloni emphasized the importance of evaluating investments through the lens of national interest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: Meloni&#8217;s relationship with <strong>Tesla Inc </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a>) CEO Musk has sparked attention in Italy, especially after Musk awarded her in New York, Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-03/musk-investments-not-a-threat-to-italy-meloni-tells-corriere\">reported</a>&nbsp;on Friday. Musk has been vocal in&nbsp;the Italian political and business&nbsp;landscape, including his comments on Italy&#8217;s demographic challenges and telecom issues. Discussions between Meloni and Musk have focused on space and artificial intelligence investments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Italy&#8217;s new regulatory framework allows foreign space companies to operate, aligning with Musk&#8217;s interests. Meloni praised Musk, describing him as a &#8220;genius&#8221; and criticized the portrayal of him as a &#8220;monster&#8221; due to his political stance. Other European leaders, like German Chancellor<strong> Olaf Scholz</strong>, have been critical of Musk, particularly regarding his political affiliations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/25/01/42758665/peter-thiels-bubble-theory-gains-relevance-as-bitcoin-hovers-around-95k-extremely-hard-to-define?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Peter Thiel&#8217;s Bubble Theory Gains Relevance As Bitcoin Hovers Around $95K: &#8216;Extremely Hard To Define&#8217;</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite concerns, Meloni defended her friendship with Musk, asserting her independence in decision-making. She highlighted her government&#8217;s efforts to regulate private space activities, showcasing a balance between personal alliances and national interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The relationship between\u00a0Meloni\u00a0and\u00a0Musk\u00a0is significant as it reflects broader geopolitical and economic implications. Musk&#8217;s investments in Italy come at a time when the country is seeking to bolster its technological and space sectors. The Italian government&#8217;s new regulatory framework for foreign space companies aligns with Musk&#8217;s business interests, potentially fostering innovation and economic growth in Italy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42780378/elon-musks-x-post-now-sends-this-adult-themed-crypto-up-175?itm_source=parsely-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Elon Musk&#8217;s X Post Sends Adult-Themed Crypto Shooting Up 175%</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Disclaimer</em></strong><em>: This content was partially produced with the help of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/author/benzinga-neuro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Benzinga Neuro</a>&nbsp;and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image via Flickr</em></p>"

Rjinberk says that the current valuation is fair, but there is potential for upside if the company successfully executes its turnaround strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bill Ackman</strong>&#8216;s Pershing Square Capital Management increased its stake in Nike by 436% during the third quarter. As per its 13F filing, Nike now represents 11% of Pershing Square&#8217;s holdings with a total of 16.280 million shares valued at $1.439 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being cautiously bullish on Nike, Rjinberk said, &#8220;Using a 30x long-term multiple and my current FY27 EPS consensus, which leaves plenty of room for upside, I calculate a May 2027 target price of $97 per share. This translates into potential annual returns (CAGR) of roughly 10% or closer to 12%, including dividends.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, he added that he would be more comfortable initiating or adding to positions at lower price levels, such as below $78 per share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/market-summary/25/01/42763136/jim-cramer-says-year-end-selloff-triggered-by-fear-of-higher-capital-gains-taxes-here-are-the-rates-listed-by-irs\">Jim Cramer Says Year-End Selloff Triggered By Fear Of Higher Capital Gains Taxes: Here Are The Rates Listed By IRS</a> </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Nike reported strong Q2 earnings in December end, exceeding both revenue and earnings expectations.

After all, Carvana has been trading at lofty valuations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Forward P/E of 101\u2014a staggering premium to rivals like <strong>CarMax Inc</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/KMX#NYSE\">KMX</a>) and <strong>AutoNation Inc</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AN#NYSE\">AN</a>).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sales multiples 845% higher than its peers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Hindenburg even claims the company is inflating its valuation through $800 million in loan sales to a &#8220;suspected undisclosed related party&#8221; and cites insider selling as further evidence of an overheated stock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carvana, however, dismissed Hindenburg&#8217;s report as &#8220;misleading and inaccurate,&#8221; reiterating confidence in its 2025 growth plan, as they responded to Benzinga.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Does This Mean For Investors?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the short report, Carvana shares showed resilience, bouncing back by over 3% on Thursday after a brief dip. But the bigger question is: can the stock sustain its gains, or is this a dead-cat bounce?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With strong selling pressure and a technical setup favoring bears, investors should tread carefully. While oversold conditions can tempt bottom-fishers, the ongoing bearish signals and fundamental concerns from Hindenburg's report suggest Carvana might be stuck in reverse for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those still holding CVNA, it might be time to brace for turbulence as challenges may lie ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/24/12/42713893/benzinga-bulls-and-bears-quantum-computing-tesla-amd-and-whales-buy-270-million-dogecoin-over-4-days\">Benzinga Bulls And Bears: Quantum Computing, Tesla, AMD \u2014 And Whales Buy 270 Million Dogecoin Over 4 Days</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Shutterstock</em></p>"

Additionally, the company hosts managed properties and digital assets, the later of which produced marginal EBITDA in 2023. Caesars' US presence roughly doubled with the 2020 acquisition by Eldorado, which built its first casino in Reno, Nevada, in 1973 and expanded its presence through prior acquisitions to over 20 properties before merging with legacy Caesars. Caesars' brands include Caesars, Harrah's, Tropicana, Bally's, Isle, and Flamingo. Also, the company owns the US portion of William Hill (it sold the international operation in 2022), a digital sports betting platform.</p>\n<h3>Financial Milestones: Caesars Entertainment's Journey</h3>\n<p><strong>Market Capitalization Highlights:</strong> Above the industry average, the company's market capitalization signifies a significant scale, indicating strong confidence and market prominence.</p>\n<p><strong>Revenue Challenges:</strong> Caesars Entertainment's revenue growth over 3 months faced difficulties. As of 30 September, 2024, the company experienced a decline of approximately <strong>-4.01%</strong>. This indicates a decrease in top-line earnings. In comparison to its industry peers, the company trails behind with a growth rate lower than the average among peers in the Consumer Discretionary sector.</p>\n<p><strong>Net Margin:</strong> Caesars Entertainment's net margin lags behind industry averages, suggesting challenges in maintaining strong profitability. With a net margin of <strong>-0.31%,</strong> the company may face hurdles in effective cost management.</p>\n<p><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> The company's ROE is a standout performer, exceeding industry averages. With an impressive ROE of <strong>-0.21%,</strong> the company showcases effective utilization of equity capital.</p>\n<p><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> Caesars Entertainment's ROA lags behind industry averages, suggesting challenges in maximizing returns from its assets. With an ROA of <strong>-0.03%,</strong> the company may face hurdles in achieving optimal financial performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Debt Management:</strong> Caesars Entertainment's debt-to-equity ratio stands notably higher than the industry average, reaching <strong>6.08</strong>. This indicates a heavier reliance on borrowed funds, raising concerns about financial leverage.</p>\n<h2>How Are Analyst Ratings Determined?</h2>\n<p>Experts in banking and financial systems, analysts specialize in reporting for specific stocks or defined sectors. Their comprehensive research involves attending company conference calls and meetings, analyzing financial statements, and engaging with insiders to generate what are known as analyst ratings for stocks. Typically, analysts assess and rate each stock once per quarter.</p>\n<p>Analysts may enhance their evaluations by incorporating forecasts for metrics like growth estimates, earnings, and revenue, delivering additional guidance to investors. It is vital to acknowledge that, although experts in stocks and sectors, analysts are human and express their opinions when providing insights.</p>\n<p><strong>Breaking: Wall Street's Next Big Mover</strong></p>\n<p>Benzinga's #1 analyst just identified a stock poised for explosive growth.

        "summary": "To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from KB Home, start with the yearly target of $6,000 and divide it by KB Home&#39;s $1.00 dividend.",
        "content": "<p class=\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><strong>KB Home</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/KBH#NYSE\">KBH</a>) will release earnings for its fourth quarter, after the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/KBH/earnings\">closing bell on Thursday, Jan. 9</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analysts expect the Los Angeles-based company to report quarterly earnings at $2.46 per share, up from $1.85 per share in the year-ago period. KB Home projects to report quarterly revenue of $1.99 billion, compared to $1.67 billion a year earlier, according to data from <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard\">Benzinga Pro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Dec. 17, Wells Fargo analyst Sam Reid maintained KB Home with an Underweight rating. He also lowered the price target from\u00a0$83\u00a0to\u00a0$74.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the recent buzz around KB Home, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, KB Home offers an annual dividend yield of 1.55%. That&#8217;s a quarterly dividend amount of 25 cents per share ($1.00 a year).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from KB Home, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we take this amount and divide it by KB Home's $1.00 dividend: $6,000 / $1.00 = 6,000 shares.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So, an investor would need to own approximately $387,840 worth of KB Home, or 6,000 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $1.10 = 1,200 shares, or $77,568 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield will decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>KBH Price Action:</strong> Shares of KB Home fell by 1.6% to close at $64.64 on Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How to Find Dividend Stocks: Scan, Analyze, and Capture with Benzinga Pro\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pVF0O2lsEH4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read More: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42763645/how-to-earn-500-a-month-from-acuity-brands-stock-ahead-of-q1-earnings\">How To Earn $500 A Month From Acuity Brands Stock Ahead Of Q1 Earnings</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>"

While this represented a 7% sequential increase and a 2% rise year-over-year, it still missed Wall Street consensus estimates, which ranged from 500,000 to 510,000. Production numbers were also underwhelming, with 459,000 vehicles produced in the fourth quarter, marking a 2% decline quarter-over-quarter and a 7% drop year-over-year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Goldman Sachs analyst <strong>Mark Delaney</strong> said, \"We believe weakness in Europe (down double digits year-over-year in Q4) was offset by growth in China (mid to high teens growth year-over-year in Q4), and that U.S. deliveries were down modestly year-over-year, with growth from Cybertruck offset by declines in other models.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Goldman&#8217;s Lowered 2025 Delivery Estimates</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Goldman Sachs now expects Tesla to deliver 2.01 million vehicles in 2025, down from its prior estimate of 2.03 million. This still implies a 12% year-over-year growth, but it falls short of Tesla's own target of 20%-30% annual growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Delaney highlighted the importance of Tesla's upcoming models in achieving higher growth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"We believe that the degree to which the features and costs of new model(s) are differentiated enough versus what Tesla currently provides, and when Tesla launches new models, will be key variables in determining how fast Tesla grows,\" he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For 2026, Goldman Sachs maintains its delivery forecast of 2.3 million units, offsetting slightly lower expectations for premium models (S/X/Cybertruck) with higher growth assumptions for Tesla's more affordable models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Goldman Sachs also lowered its 2024 earnings-per-share estimate from $2.01 to $2 and its 2025 EPS estimate from $2.85 to $2.80.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Full Self-Driving Progress and Robotaxi Potential</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla continues to make strides in its Full Self-Driving software, with version 13 rolled out to customers in late 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crowdsourced data from Tesla's FSDtracker indicates that miles to critical intervention have improved to 260-400 miles under v13, compared to 200-300 miles under the prior version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Tesla appears to lead in autonomous vehicle technology, the road to achieving a level of safety superior to human drivers remains challenging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Goldman Sachs indicates Tesla is unlikely to reach this goal by the second quarter of 2025 but suggests that the company could launch a limited robotaxi service in the next 12-24 months using remote assistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the short-term headwinds, Goldman Sachs reiterated its 12-month price target of $345 for Tesla stock, holding a Neutral rating. The firm highlighted fundamental challenges to the core auto business but recognized the potential for stronger long-term growth driven by software and services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/25/01/42777529/goldman-sachs-adds-3-stocks-to-conviction-list-flags-5-market-trends-to-monitor-in-2025\">Goldman Sachs Adds 3 Stocks To &#8216;Conviction List,&#8217; Flags 5 Market Trends To Monitor In 2025</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Courtesy Tesla</em></p>"

participants.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With a Price to Book ratio of <b>9.19</b>, which is <b>3.44x</b> the industry average, Meta Platforms might be considered overvalued in terms of its book value, as it is trading at a higher multiple compared to its industry peers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Price to Sales ratio of <b>10.06</b>, which is <b>3.38x</b> the industry average, suggests the stock could

aiding in informed decision-making.</p>\n<p>By considering the Debt-to-Equity ratio, Meta Platforms can be compared to its top 4 peers, leading to the following observations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Compared to its top 4 peers, Meta Platforms has a stronger financial position indicated by its lower debt-to-equity ratio of <b>0.3</b>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This suggests that the company relies less on debt financing and has a more favorable balance between debt and equity, which can be seen as a positive attribute by investors.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<p>For Meta Platforms, the PE ratio is low compared to peers, indicating potential undervaluation. The high PB and PS ratios suggest the market values the company's assets and sales highly. In terms of ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and revenue growth, Meta Platforms outperforms its industry peers, reflecting strong financial performance and growth potential.</p>\n<p><em>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.</em></p>"

However, the tech titan faces challenges. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42760822/ubs-cuts-iphone-sales-forecast-for-december-as-apple-faces-stiff-competition-from-other-players\">UBS analysts recently gave Apple a neutral rating</a> with a price target of $236, citing weaker-than-expected iPhone sales. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dwindling demand and declining market share in China have raised concerns, particularly during the critical holiday sales season. Nonetheless, Apple holds a consensus \u2018buy&#8217; rating from 30 analysts, with a price target of $245.27 per share, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Benzinga Pro</a>. It shows that Apple is still a strong long-term player.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming to Nvidia, the chipmaker is riding the artificial intelligence wave, with its stock climbing more than 180% in 2024. The\u00a0firm&#8217;s market\u00a0cap reached\u00a0a\u00a0high of\u00a0$3.29 trillion,\u00a0an\u00a0amount\u00a0that\u00a0threatens\u00a0to\u00a0close\u00a0the\u00a0gap with the\u00a0$3.79 trillion\u00a0of Apple.\u00a0At this rate,\u00a0if Nvidia\u00a0does\u00a0not\u00a0lose\u00a0momentum in 2025, one might speculate that it could once again challenge Apple as the most valuable company in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft also continues to thrive on many fronts. Its near-monopoly on in-office software with Office and Dynamics 365, coupled with the dominance of LinkedIn, has cemented its position. The company&#8217;s cloud-based solutions, including Azure, OpenAI, and GitHub, remain key growth drivers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Vanguard's Stellar Performance and Outlook</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Vanguard has been a top performer, with the market price growing almost 25% in 2024, outpacing the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s 23% gain. This impressive performance reflects its focus on high-growth companies, particularly in technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the S&amp;P 500 has typically been averaging an annual return of around 10% since 1965, according to Berkshire Hathaway&nbsp;data, Vanguard's targeted strategy on growth stocks within the index gives it an edge. The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF offers investors a cost-efficient way to tap into the U.S. equity market&#8217;s largest and most stable companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/content/42720025/these-3-quirky-etfs-may-be-strong-plays-in-2025\">These 3 Quirky ETFs May Be Strong Plays in 2025</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>"

Trial is currently scheduled for the week of Feb. 24.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Desktop also announced that it has filed a second lawsuit against Nano that names <strong>Markforged Holding Corporation</strong> as another defendant. The lawsuit alleges that Nano&#8217;s agreement to acquire Markforged, if completed, would breach the merger agreement between Desktop and Nano.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, it would breach Nano&#8217;s agreement to avoid acquisitions that could significantly increase the risk of a governmental order blocking or materially delaying the completion of the merger between Desktop and Nano. Desktop seeks to block the merger between Nano and Markforged until its merger with Nano is finalized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42785216/why-clean-tech-company-n2off-shares-jumping-premarket-friday\">Why Is Clean Tech Company N2OFF Stock Jumping Premarket Friday?</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DM Price Action: </strong>At the time of writing, Desktop Metal stock is trading 12.4% higher at $3.02, according to data from <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/pro/\">Benzinga Pro.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: 5846648 from Pixabay.</em></p>"

On this day, 16 years ago, <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto </strong>mined the genesis block of <strong>Bitcoin </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/btc/usd\">BTC</a>), forever changing the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/crypto\">world of cryptocurrency.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To celebrate the 16th birthday of Bitcoin, here are 16 fun facts about the cryptocurrency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. First Purchase:&nbsp;</strong>On May 22, 2010, history was made when&nbsp;<strong>Laszlo Hanyecz </strong>paid&nbsp;10,000 Bitcoin<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/05/21185577/anthony-pompliano-launches-bitcoin-pizza-what-you-should-know-and-how-to-buy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&nbsp;for two pizzas</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<strong>Papa John&#8217;s International</strong>. The purchase of the two pizzas became the first goods transacted with Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;pizzas cost around $41 at the time. The Bitcoin used to purchase the pizzas would be worth over $460 million today, based on the current price of the cryptocurrency. May 22 is celebrated as Bitcoin Pizza Day every year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Ethereum Co-Founder Ties To Bitcoin: Vitalik Buterin</strong>, one of the co-founders of&nbsp;<strong>Ethereum&nbsp;</strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/eth/usd\">ETH</a>),took a side job in 2011&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/09/22811912/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-ethereum-creator-vitalik-buterin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">working for Bitcoin Weekly</a>. As a writer, Buterin was paid five Bitcoin for each article written. Later that year, Buterin founded Bitcoin Magazine, where he was the lead writer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buterin launched the white paper for Ethereum in late 2013 and officially launched the cryptocurrency on July 30, 2015.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Expensive Missing Wallet:&nbsp;James Howells</strong>&nbsp;threw out a hard drive in 2013 that contained his digital wallet. The wallet contained 8,000 Bitcoins. Howells, who lives in Wales, is trying to get the local city council to allow him to excavate the landfill in a last-ditch effort to find the hard drive containing the Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Howells offered a portion of the proceeds to the city if it allows him the chance to search. In 2024, Howells sued the<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/11/42232028/remember-james-howells-who-lost-his-hard-drive-with-8000-bitcoins-now-worth-760m-his-ex-girlfriend-reveals-it-was-she-who-threw-it-away\"> local city council </a>for not allowing him to excavate the landfill site.

Poll Finds Over 60% Say\u2026</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Satoshi Nakamoto, Still Anonymous?:&nbsp;</strong>The creator of Bitcoin remains anonymous to this date.&nbsp;<strong>Craig Wright&nbsp;</strong>previously fought in<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/12/30182902/craig-wright-drops-controversial-quest-to-prove-hes-bitcoin-creator-only-validation-i-seek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&nbsp;a court case</a>&nbsp;to claim that he created Bitcoin, but many in the cryptocurrency community doubt the claim. Tesla CEO<strong>&nbsp;Elon Musk&nbsp;</strong>has<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/12/24811305/elon-musk-offers-his-theory-on-the-identity-of-bitcoin-godfather-satoshi-nakomoto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&nbsp;supported a theory&nbsp;</a>that computer scientist<strong>&nbsp;Nick Szabo</strong>&nbsp;created Bitcoin. Szabo is one of a dozen or so names including Wright that are often linked to the identity of Nakamoto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024, a Bitcoin documentary titled \"Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery\" from investigative filmmaker<strong> Cullen Hoback </strong>added to the mystery. The documentary <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/10/41242615/peter-todd-is-satoshi-nakamoto-bitcoin-core-developer-denies-hbo-documentary-claims-im-not\">said that Bitcoin engineer </a><strong>Peter Todd</strong> is most likely Satoshi Nakamoto, a claim which he denied.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The anonymous founder of Bitcoin is estimated to hold between 600,000 and 1.1 million Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Bitcoin White Paper:&nbsp;</strong>Before the official genesis mint of Bitcoin, there was the idea of the concept that became the cryptocurrency. On Oct. 31, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto released the&nbsp;white paper&nbsp;called &#8220;Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.&#8221; The white paper laid out themes like&nbsp;time-stamped transactions, proof-of-work, privacy and a simplified payment verification method.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution,&#8221; the opening sentence of the white paper read. Satoshi&#8217;s white paper is considered required reading for anyone in the cryptocurrency space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Nakamoto Statues:&nbsp;</strong>Despite Nakamoto being anonymous, a statue&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/10/41255580/satoshi-nakamoto-identity-remains-a-mystery-after-hbo-documentary-bronze-statue-celebrates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">was&nbsp;created&nbsp;to honor&nbsp;</a>the Bitcoin founder and unveiled in September 2021. The Satoshi Nakamoto statue can be found in Graphisoft Park, located in Budapest, Hungary. The statue features Satoshi wearing a hoodie with the Bitcoin logo on its chest. The Nakamoto statue is free to visit 24 hours a day. The group behind the sculpture accepts donations made to their crypto wallets to increase awareness for the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The statue is made of bronze, the face is made of a special bronze-aluminum composite, thus every visitor can see their own face when looking at Satoshi. We are all Satoshi,&#8221; the statue&#8217;s website reads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024, a new Satoshi Nakamoto statue was unveiled in Lugano, Switzerland. The statue honors the anonymity of Nakamoto by appearing transparent from the front and changing the view based on the angle the statue is viewed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Coinbase Creation:</strong>&nbsp;Without the launch of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, many public companies of today that mine cryptocurrency or act as trading platforms might not exist. One of the companies that owes a lot to the creation of Bitcoin is&nbsp;<strong>Coinbase Global Inc</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/COIN#NASDAQ\">COIN</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coinbase founder&nbsp;<strong>Brian Armstrong&nbsp;</strong>said he started the process of creating Coinbase after reading the Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin white paper. Armstrong then started coding an early prototype of Coinbase on nights and weekends. Armstrong and many early Coinbase employees opted to be paid a portion of their salary in Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8. Silk Road Shut Down:&nbsp;</strong>One of the knocks against Bitcoin over the years has been the usage of cryptocurrencies for illegal activities due to the anonymity of people making transactions. Online black market Silk Road was one of several marketplaces that used Bitcoin for money laundering, illegal drug transactions and other illegal activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. government seized more than 170,000 Bitcoins in 2013. The government sold off the Bitcoins in auctions in 2014 and 2015.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Bitcoin as Currency:&nbsp;</strong>One of the biggest cryptocurrency stories of 2021 was the&nbsp;announcement&nbsp;by El Salvador that Bitcoin would become an official currency of the country. El Salvador President&nbsp;<strong>Nayib Bukele</strong>&nbsp;announced in September that the country purchased 200 Bitcoins and would buy more. The country was the first to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10. Bitcoin Unit Named After Founder:</strong>&nbsp;The smallest unit of Bitcoin is called a Satoshi, in reference to the anonymous creator of the cryptocurrency. One Satoshi is equal to 100 millionth of a Bitcoin. The smaller unit size and name are used to help with smaller transactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>11. Limited Supply:</strong>&nbsp;Nearly 20 million Bitcoin have been&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/how-many-bitcoins-are-there/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">mined</a>, as of the time of writing. Bitcoin comes with a limited supply of 21 million. After the 21 million Bitcoins are mined, no more will be able to be accumulated through the mining method, leaving only the existing Bitcoin to be bought and sold. This means there are currently around 1.4 million Bitcoin left to be mined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Estimates call for the last Bitcoin to be mined in 2140, but that number could fluctuate as a rising price of Bitcoin has led more companies to get into Bitcoin mining.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Bitcoin Halving:&nbsp;</strong>A Bitcoin halving occurs every 210,000 blocks, which<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/what-is-bitcoin-how-does-it-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&nbsp;happens roughly every four years</a>. The block rewards get halved as soon as the 210,000<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;block is mined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin halving is a method put in place for the cryptocurrency to help enforce synthetic price inflation until all Bitcoin have been mined and released. Theoretically, the Bitcoin halvings that occur should make it more expensive to create new Bitcoins and make the cryptocurrency more valuable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin acts the opposite of fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar with this method as currencies often lose their purchasing power over time instead of becoming more valuable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first Bitcoin halving happened on Nov. 28, 2012, followed by halving events in July 2016, May 2020 and April 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>All-Time Highs In 2021, 2024:</strong>&nbsp;Bitcoin enjoyed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/12/36083106/heres-how-much-100-invested-in-bitcoin-today-will-be-worth-if-crypto-hits-new-all-time-hig\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a strong 2021</a>&nbsp;that saw the cryptocurrency added to the balance sheets of&nbsp;<strong>Tesla Inc&nbsp;</strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a>),&nbsp;<strong>Block Inc </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SQ#NYSE\">SQ</a>)&nbsp;and other public companies. The cryptocurrency also hit an all-time high of $68,789.63 in 2021. Bitcoin traded at a range of $28,722.76 and $68,789.63 in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took three years for Bitcoin, with 2024 presidential election acting as a catalyst, to hit <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/12/42367065/exclusive-bitcoin-briefly-tops-100000-but-where-do-benzinga-readers-predict-it-will-finish-2024\">new all-time highs</a> in 2024. The cryptocurrency continued to hit several new highs including soaring past the $100,000 milestone briefly in late 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>14. Market Cap Over $1 Trillion</strong>: In 2021, Bitcoin hit a market capitalization of $1 trillion for the first time. The cryptocurrency is the most valuable in the industry, with a market capitalization of $1.92 trillion at the time of writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With its current market capitalization, Bitcoin would rank as the sixth most valuable company in the world, trailing only Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>15. Bitcoin ETFs:</strong>&nbsp;One of the top news stories for 2024 surrounding Bitcoin was the<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/01/36449219/bitcoin-crosses-45k-with-all-eyes-on-etf-countdown-is-jan-10-the-date-that-crypto-changes-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> approval of several Bitcoin ETFs</a>, which came after a federal court ruled against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and directed the regulatory agency to review the application from Grayscale Investments to convert its&nbsp;<strong>Grayscale Bitcoin Trust</strong>&nbsp;(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GBTC#NYSE\">GBTC</a>)&nbsp;into an ETF.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is one of the top Bitcoin ETFs by assets under management today, ranking second as of the time of writing with $19.3 billion. The <strong>iShares Bitcoin Trust</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/IBIT#NASDAQ\">IBIT</a>) ranks first with $52.1 billion, followed by GBTC, <strong>Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund</strong> (BATS:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/FBTC#BATS\">FBTC</a>) and <strong>Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF</strong> (BATS:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ARKB#BATS\">ARKB</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On July 1, 2013,&nbsp;<strong>Gemini&nbsp;</strong>founders&nbsp;<strong>Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/24/12/42519107/if-you-invested-1000-in-bitcoin-when-the-first-bitcoin-etf-was-filed-heres-how-much-youd-have-today\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">filed the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust</a>&nbsp;as a planned Bitcoin ETF. The Winklevoss twins saw their initial filing and a second attempt rejected in 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>16</strong>. <strong>U.S. Election Turns to Crypto</strong>: The 2024 U.S. presidential election saw one of the issues on voters' minds being cryptocurrency regulation and support. <strong>Donald Trump</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/09/41096120/if-you-invested-1-000-in-bitcoin-when-donald-trump-said-he-wasnt-a-fan-heres-how-much-youd\">showed a change of heart </a>after being against crypto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If you like crypto in any form\u2026if you&#8217;re in favor of crypto you&#8217;d better vote for Trump,&#8221; the former president said in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump's campaign team went on to be the first major party campaign to<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38952866/trump-accepts-cryptocurrency-donations-in-bitcoin-ethereum-shiba-inu-dogecoin-and-more-say\"> accept cryptocurrency donations</a>, following several primary candidates starting this practice.

Analysts at Value Partners, as reported by Reuters, attributed the rally to stronger-than-expected policy support from Chinese authorities, including interest rate cuts, property incentives, and funding programs to boost stock buying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banking stocks stood out as top performers in China, increasing 34.7%, with the biggest state banks soaring to multi-year highs.

Sellers are forced to offer their shares at a discount to get buyers interested. This forces the price lower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the downtrend reaches a support level, it will pause or halt. There are enough buy orders to fill all of the sell orders. Traders who wish to sell can do so without having to worry about pushing the price lower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the stock does eventually trade and stay below the level that was support, it is called a &#8220;breakdown.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This illustrates an important market dynamic. It shows that the traders and investors who created the support with their buy orders have canceled or finished.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"564\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/03112555/AMD.1.2025-1024x564.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-717432\" srcset=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/03112555/AMD.1.2025-1024x564.png 1024w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/03112555/AMD.1.2025-300x165.png 300w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/03112555/AMD.1.2025-768x423.png 768w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/03112555/AMD.1.2025.png 1489w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42775636/ces-2025-preview-nvidia-amd-in-spotlight-other-trends-and-stocks-to-watch\">CES 2025 Preview: Nvidia And AMD Grab Spotlight, Other Trends And Stocks To Watch</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This puts those who want to sell in an uncomfortable position. They will need to force the price lower to get buyers off of the sidelines and back into the market.

There is a good chance this support breaks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Markets don't go in straight lines. They form a series of peaks and valleys. When a peak forms at a lower price than the prior peak, it is called a &#8220;lower high.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This also illustrates an important market dynamic. It shows that as time passes, sellers are becoming more aggressive. They are willing to enter the market and sell their shares at lower prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the valleys form at the same price level as the previous ones, it shows that the buyers are willing to be patient and wait for the sellers to come to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see on the chart, this has been the case with AMD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combination of aggressive sellers and patient buyers is bearish.

This note includes an updated AVOD model influenced by new global connected TV advertising estimates from GroupM and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Netflix is now executing well on appealing creative content, including marquee IP, such as the new Squid Game season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even beyond an intelligent sports approach emphasizing special live events, sports documentaries, and sports entertainment, Netflix is also dropping non-fiction content, including biohacker Silicon Valley entrepreneur Bryan Johnson.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Netflix&#8217;s move fast and break things approach, a Silicon Valley rather than media company mentality, has enabled eclectic hits, including Stranger Things and Squid Game, and off a significant lead in international programming. This entails embarrassing flops, likely including a new cookery show from Meghan Markel. Competing old media company streaming entrants, including Peacock and Max, are creating more breakthrough content and have narrowed the gap in pure technology aspects, including streaming Quality of Service (QoS) and scaling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with the company&#8217;s admittedly exemplary execution assumptions underlying the new target, they are optimistic. These include Netflix reaching 490 million members in 2033 with a ~37% operating profit margin and an eight-year discounted cash flow approach that assumes a normalized 37 times P/E for the index in estimating the cost of equity. This compares to a median Nasdaq 100 multiple in the 23.5 times vicinity, implying Netflix would be vulnerable in any sell-off in the tech-heavy index.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the global TAMs for TV subscriptions and high-growth connected TV advertising revenues are substantial, these overall subscription and advertising markets are highly mature relative to the AI-related names driving the Nasdaq 100.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harrigan projected fourth-quarter revenue of $9.83 billion and EPS of $3.88.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price Action: </strong>NFLX stock is up 0.16% at $888.16 at the last check on Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/media/24/12/42727432/att-and-verizon-contain-cyberattack-linked-to-chinas-salt-typhoon-group\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AT&amp;T and Verizon Contain Cyberattack Linked to China&#8217;s Salt Typhoon Group</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image via Shutterstock</em></p>"

Shares of <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-alcohol-stocks\">alcohol stocks</a> are trading lower after <strong>U.S. Surgeon General Murthy</strong> issued an advisory warning alcohol consumption could raise cancer risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What To Know:</strong> The announcement heightens public awareness of the health dangers linked to alcohol consumption and <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/regulations/25/01/42787400/alcohol-consumption-increases-cancer-risk-surgeon-general-warns-calls-for-changes-in-warning-labels\">could lead to stricter regulations</a>, such as updated warning labels and lower recommended drinking limits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a company reliant on beer sales, Molson Coors may face reduced consumer demand if these warnings deter drinking, especially among health-conscious demographics. Additionally, potential regulatory changes could increase costs related to compliance, marketing and product labeling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since beer represents a significant share of Molson Coors&#8217; revenue, heightened scrutiny of alcohol's role in cancer could disproportionately impact its financial outlook compared to that of diversified alcohol producers. Investor uncertainty about future sales and increased regulatory risks likely contributed to the stock's sharp decline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42787508/biden-blocks-149b-takeover-of-us-steel-shares-plunge\">Biden Blocks $14.9B US Steel Takeover, Shares Plunge</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How To Buy TAP Stock</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides going to a brokerage platform to purchase a share &#8211; or fractional share &#8211; of stock, you can also gain access to shares either by buying an exchange traded fund (ETF) that holds the stock itself, or by allocating yourself to a strategy in your 401(k) that would seek to acquire shares in a mutual fund or other instrument. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in Molson Coors Beverage&#8217;s case, it is in the Consumer Staples sector. An ETF will likely hold shares in many liquid and large companies that help track that sector, allowing an investor to gain exposure to the trends within that segment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to data from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/register174\">Benzinga Pro</a>, TAP has a 52-week high of $69.18 and a 52-week low of $49.19.</p>"

From technical bearish signals to a major acquisition roadblock, the <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/X/news\">stock is under pressure</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, analysts believe opportunities may still exist for investors willing to ride out the storm.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bearish Signals Dominate X Stock Charts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>US Steel's stock performance has been disappointing, with a 36.74% decline over the past year, compounded by 22.76% and 19.64% drops in six months and the past month, respectively. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://bzresearch.myclickfunnels.com/benzinga-pro-content-webinar-registration/?utm_source=BZprocontent010325&amp;t=be2bearmibe3na1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"625\" height=\"492\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/03113045/Screenshot-2025-01-03-at-10.00.25-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-717452\" srcset=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/03113045/Screenshot-2025-01-03-at-10.00.25-PM.png 625w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/03113045/Screenshot-2025-01-03-at-10.00.25-PM-300x236.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://bzresearch.myclickfunnels.com/benzinga-pro-content-webinar-registration/?utm_source=BZprocontent010325&amp;t=be2bearmibe3na1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chart created using Benzinga Pro</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key technical indicators suggest bearish momentum is strong. The stock price of $30.48 is below its eight, 20, 50 and 200-day simple moving averages, with the MACD indicator at a negative 1.63 reinforcing a negative outlook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/25/01/42780788/us-steel-tumbles-nearly-10-in-overnight-trading-on-robinhood-as-biden-reportedly-plans-to-block-149b-nippon-steel-merger\">US Steel Tumbles Nearly 10% In Overnight Trading On Robinhood As Biden Reportedly Plans To Block $14.9B Nippon Steel Merger</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Biden Blocks NSC's $55-Per-Share Bid</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a dramatic twist, President <strong>Joe</strong> <strong>Biden</strong> officially blocked <strong>Nippon Steel Corp</strong>'s (OTCPK:NISTF) (OTCPK:NPSCY) $55-per-share bid for US Steel, citing national security and supply chain concerns. This decision ends the 382-day acquisition saga, leaving both <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/movers/25/01/42787508/biden-blocks-14-9b-us-steel-takeover-shares-plunge\">US Steel and NSC reeling.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>JPMorgan analyst Bill Peterson expects a sharp decline in the stock, potentially into the high $20s. However, he remains constructive, with a valuation outlook above $40, emphasizing US Steel&#8217;s growth prospects.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Lies Ahead?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Peterson outlines two potential paths for US Steel. The company could remain a standalone entity, focusing on its Big River Steel operations and transitioning legacy blast furnace assets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, domestic players like <strong>Cleveland-Cliffs Inc</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/CLF#NYSE\">CLF</a>) may bid for parts of the company. Cleveland-Cliffs has already shown interest in acquiring blast furnace assets, though antitrust issues could complicate a deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Market Challenges Add Pressure</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The steel market itself is not providing much relief. Hot-rolled coil prices, currently at $694\u2013$675 per ton, remain well below benchmarks set by competitors like <strong>Nucor Corp</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NUE#NYSE\">NUE</a>) and Cleveland-Cliffs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With auto demand softening and construction activity reliant on potential rate cuts, the outlook for steel pricing through 2025 remains cautious, the analyst notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Long-Term Potential</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the current turbulence, Peterson highlights US Steel's growth drivers, including the Big River Steel expansion and new product lines. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He sees the stock's standalone valuation supported by these initiatives, although investors may need patience to realize gains.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaway</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While US Steel faces immediate hurdles, its long-term potential remains intact, particularly if market dynamics improve or strategic domestic deals materialize. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investors should weigh these factors carefully as the company navigates a challenging landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/regulations/25/01/42787400/alcohol-increases-cancer-risk-surgeon-general-warns\"><strong>Molson Coors, Diageo, Boston Beer Tumble As Surgeon General Warns &#8216;Alcohol Consumption Increases&#8217; Cancer Risk</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Vladimir Mulder/Shutterstock.com</em></p>"

The ETF, which magnifies natural gas futures movements by a factor of two, is highly sensitive to price volatility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What To Know:</strong> The price collapse was spurred by milder weather forecasts and a smaller-than-expected inventory withdrawal of 116 Bcf, versus analyst expectations of 127 Bcf. This tempered near-term demand expectations, eroding bullish momentum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42790572/us-natural-gas-prices-drop-sharply-as-new-weather-forecasts-lower-weekly-inventory-pull-weigh-on-demand\">updated forecasts</a> for mid-January predict fewer heating degree days, signaling reduced heating demand despite ongoing winter storms. The subdued outlook diminished speculative buying interest in BOIL, which thrives in volatile, bullish environments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stock's decline underscores its inherent risk as a leveraged product, amplifying losses during natural gas price pullbacks.

Tesla tends to deliver excitement when it refreshes its portfolio.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>GLJ Research:</strong> Weaker than expected delivery and production figures from Tesla could suggest \"stormy weather\" ahead for Tesla bulls in 2025, Johnson said in a new investor note.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Johnson asks questions in the note about Tesla CEO <strong>Elon Musk's</strong> previous comments about having access to real-time data on vehicle orders and the ability to make pricing, production and inventory decisions quickly compared to a longer lead time for other automotive companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"With TSLA producing just 459.445K cars in 4Q24 vs. stated capacity of &gt;587.5k or utilization of just 78.2%, in this note we attempt to answer the question,\" Johnson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Johnson suggests production of 459.445k could be the \"new run-rate\" for Tesla based on global demand, which would mean demand has peaked at less than two million cars sold per year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This would mean that Street consensus estimates of more than two million vehicle sales for Tesla in 2025 and future years would be off, Johnson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla had inventory of 96.033k units in the fourth quarter. That&#8217;s the lowest level since the first quarter of 2023, Johnson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The record drawdown of TSLA's inventory seen in 4Q24 suggests they see demand headwinds as imminent.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Johnson said Tesla stock could come under \"significant selling pressure\" with investors turning to fundamentals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analyst predicts Tesla's upcoming fourth-quarter earnings report this month will be a \"bloodbath quarter.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Truist: </strong>Deliveries and production were lower than Street estimates in the fourth quarter. This caused an inventory burn, Stein said in a new investor note.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fourth-quarter deliveries were 4.4% below his estimates, while production was 12.7% below his estimates and below the delivery total.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stein said data analysis suggests Tesla's average selling prices were down quarter-over-quarter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Longer-term, we expect ASPs to continue facing downward pressure as we anticipate TSLA will continue to flex pricing to stimulate demand,\" Stein said. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analyst uses a discounted cash flow methodology for the Tesla price target. Stein estimates revenue and profitability for current and future Tesla businesses, including automotive, energy, FSD, Dojo and Optimus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TSLA Price Action:</strong> Tesla stock is up 3% to $389.20 Friday versus a 52-week trading range of $138.80 to $488.54.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/25/01/42772702/tesla-analyst-says-fsd-test-drive-shows-imperfections-not-ready-for-prime-time-yet\">Tesla Analyst Says FSD Test Drive Shows Imperfections, &#8216;Not Ready For Prime Time Yet&#8217;</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>"

The previous&nbsp;Trump&nbsp;administration, from 2016 to 2020, blocked and sued or threatened to block a lot of big deals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you recall:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AT&amp;T </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/T#NYSE\">T</a>) and<strong> Time Warner</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/17/11/10748659/at-t-resists-doj-order-to-divest-time-warners-cnn-for-merger-approval\">failed to ink a deal</a>.

Sinclair <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/24/11/41805370/jim-cramer-hopes-m-a-to-come-back-bigly-under-trump-administration\">paid a hefty fee</a> for whiffing.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Broadcom Inc </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AVGO#NASDAQ\">AVGO</a>) and <strong>Qualcomm Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/QCOM#NASDAQ\">QCOM</a>), had they merged, could have affected U.S. national security, a federal <a href=\"https://www.investors.com/news/technology/broadcom-buyout-of-qualcomm-looking-doubtful-after-federal-probe/\">probe</a> showed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>DraftKings Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/DKNG#NASDAQ\">DKNG</a>) and<strong> FanDuel</strong>: A merger of the two largest daily fantasy sports platforms was blocked to preserve competition in the industry.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Department of Justice also mandated divestitures in major transactions.

In addition, the company will unveil the design for the Phase 3 program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The release of the Phase 3 design comes after a successful End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the Food and Drug Administration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ACELYRIN CEO <strong>Mina Kim</strong>, Chief Medical Officer Dr. <strong>Shep Mpofu</strong> and Chief Commercial Officer <strong>Ken Lock </strong>will be joined at the virtual event by Drs.<strong> Andrea Kossler </strong>of the Stanford University School of Medicine and<strong> Prem Subramanian </strong>of the University of Colorado School of Medicine, both members of ACELYRIN&#8217;s Scientific and Patient Advisory Boards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How To Buy ACELYRIN Stock</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Acelyrin &#8211; be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-stock-trading-platforms\">possible trading platforms here.</a> Many will allow you to buy \u2018fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to \u2018go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock\">stock can be found at this resource.</a> Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading &#8211; either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42791359/nasdaq-surges-over-100-points-cerence-shares-spike-higher\">Nasdaq Surges Over 1%; Cerence Shares Spike Higher</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>SLRN Price Action: </strong>At the time of writing, ACELYRIN stock is trading 14.6% higher at $3.78, according to data from <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/pro/\">Benzinga Pro.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Image: Akava Photo from Pixabay</em></p>"

MGM's US sports and i-gaming operations are currently a high-single-digit percentage of its total revenue.

Analysts may attend company conference calls and meetings, research company financial statements, and communicate with insiders to publish \"analyst ratings\" for stocks. Analysts typically rate each stock once per quarter.</p>\n<p>Some analysts publish their predictions for metrics such as growth estimates, earnings, and revenue to provide additional guidance with their ratings.

For the year, the EV-maker's China sales reached 657,000 vehicles\u2014an 8.8% on-year increase. These numbers reveal that China remains critical for Tesla, contributing around 40% of its global deliveries in Q4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla's deepening foothold in China has also spurred a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42761825/ev-price-war-heats-up-as-chinese-automakers-extend-subsidies\">competitive battle of sorts involving prices</a>. The Austin, Texas-based company made the smart move of putting a 10,000-yuan discount on Model Y loans through December. This prompted Nio and Li Auto to follow suit with zero-interest loans and cash subsidies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nio's December sales spiked 72.9% year-over-year while Li Auto posted a 16.2% increase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BYD, for its part, offered up to 11.5% discounts and reaped the rewards in the form of a 50% year-over-year jump in December sales of new energy passenger vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>XPeng, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/global/24/12/42737888/tesla-rival-xpeng-to-hire-over-6000-workers-in-2025-expecting-increased-competition-report\">plans to onboard over 6,000 employees</a> in 2025, Reuters reported.

Nevertheless, <strong>Tesla Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a>) CEO Elon Musk <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/05/38840114/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-says-china-is-awesome-after-biden-escalates-ev-tariff-battle-those-who-have-not\">recognizes the upside potential</a> of XPEV stock and its ilk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, during Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings call in January, Musk had choice words for the Chinese EV competition. \"Frankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world. So they&#8217;re extremely good.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's not just empty praise. In the middle of 2024, XPeng announced that it would <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/06/39434026/xpeng-revamps-smart-driving-team-launches-ai-division-to-stay-competitive-in-autonomous-race-rep\">reorganize its smart driving team</a> in a bid to stay competitive in the autonomous mobility space. Part of this overall directive was the establishment of an artificial intelligence department to concentrate on innovative technologies such as end-to-end solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few days ago, a Reuters report indicated that XPeng <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/global/24/12/42737888/tesla-rival-xpeng-to-hire-over-6000-workers-in-2025-expecting-increased-competition-report\">will hire more than 6,000 workers</a> this year, a response to the expected rise in competition. Further, the company seeks to expand its global footprint to over 60 markets in 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ambitiousness appears justified, especially given November's deliveries count of 30,895 vehicles, representing a 54% year-over-year increase.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>XPeng Stock Could Be Due For a Comeback</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Although XPeng investors seemingly enjoy multiple fundamental catalysts, the stock simply has not cooperated. Over the past 52 weeks, the security slipped about 17%. Over the trailing five years, it roughly gave up half its market value. Still, some technical factors lend credence to the possibility of incoming upside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, the stock appears to be forming a bullish <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/falling-wedge-pattern\">falling wedge</a>. In this pattern, the upper and lower trendlines (which are tilted against the prevailing price trend) converge toward a focal point. The hypothesis is that at or near this apex, the target security will likely break out.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"592\" src=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/03141508/XPEV-stock-01032025-1024x592.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-717686\" srcset=\"https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/03141508/XPEV-stock-01032025-1024x592.jpg 1024w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/03141508/XPEV-stock-01032025-300x174.jpg 300w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/03141508/XPEV-stock-01032025-768x444.jpg 768w,https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/03141508/XPEV-stock-01032025.jpg 1032w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While XPeng stock is down over the past 52 weeks, since late August, it has conspicuously shot higher. Therefore, at the moment, the prevailing trend points northward. Therefore, the falling wedge could be a temporary correction, allowing professional bearish speculators to extract \"negative\" value before they move onto their next target.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, while Benzinga's <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/insights/options/25/01/42771276/spotlight-on-xpeng-analyzing-the-surge-in-options-activity\">options scanner</a> reported significant bearish activity against the stock, the timing of the data matters. The purchased puts of noteworthy volume all expire at the close of the Friday session. With this cloud soon to be removed, the bulls could potentially move in, pushing XPeng higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a related note, satellite constellation specialist <strong>AST SpaceMobile Inc </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ASTS#NASDAQ\">ASTS</a>) also printed a falling wedge pattern. After spiking higher from mid-May last year, AST SpaceMobile began correcting since August. From November, a falling wedge formed, eventually leading to today's big swing higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Setting Up a Bull Call Spread</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Armed with the compelling prospect of a strong upswing coming, traders may consider a relatively simple multi-leg options strategy called the <strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/bull-spread\">bull call spread</a>.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This transaction involves buying a call option and simultaneously selling a call at a higher strike price for the same expiration date. Primarily, the key concept revolves around taking the credit received from the short call to partially offset the debit paid for the long call.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to keep in mind that this trade is a capped-risk, capped-reward opportunity; that is, the maximum loss and maximum reward are known prior to inking the transaction. That said, one of the key benefits is that the threshold to profitability is lowered. In a straight call option, the underlying security must rise to the strike price plus the premium paid to break even. In a call spread, the premium is reduced by the short call credit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For ambitious traders, the 11/13 bull call spread (buy the $11 call, sell the $13 call) for the options chain expiring Jan. 31, 2025, could be enticing. This trade leaves about a month for XPeng stock to hit the short strike price of $13, which roughly coincides with the lower ceiling of the falling wedge's upper trendline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More conservative traders may opt for the 11/12 bull call spread for the same expiration date. This trade is attractive since the bulls will likely strive toward the psychologically significant $12 level. However, if XPeng stock rises materially above this point, the capped-reward transaction means that the upside performance would be wasted as an opportunity cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: <br>    <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/25/01/42774789/intel-slump-offers-rebound-ahead-of-q4-earnings\">\u2022 Options Corner: Intel&#8217;s Slump Potentially Offers Rebound Ahead Of Q4 Earnings</a></strong></p>"

        "content": "<p>U.S. Rep. <strong>Mike Johnson</strong> (R-La.) has been re-elected as speaker of the house after a close vote Friday that needed meetings with holdouts to change their votes as the new session of<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/congress\"> Congress began Friday.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Johnson faced pressure from several Republican holdouts ahead of Friday's vote due to his handling of a recent government spending bill that nearly saw <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/politics/24/12/42599154/elon-musk-as-speaker-of-the-house-rand-paul-shows-support-says-people-would-lose-their-ever-lovin-minds\">a government shutdown.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Friday, the first ballot for speaker saw an unofficial tally of 216 votes for Johnson and 215 votes for Rep. <strong>Hakeem Jeffries</strong> (D-N.Y.) with three Republicans choosing to not vote or picking someone different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the first ballot closed, several members of Congress held meetings and conducted phone calls to race and get the support Johnson needed to prevent more voting rounds from happening, as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/03/house-speaker-vote-live-updates/\">reported </a>by the Washington Post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reps. <strong>Ralph Norman </strong>(R-S.C.) and<strong> Keith Self</strong> (R-Texas) changed their votes in support of Johnson to push him to the 218 votes needed out of 434 to secure the majority. Rep. <strong>Thomas Massie</strong> (R-Ky.) did not switch his vote, supporting Rep. <strong>Tom Emmer</strong> for speaker instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All 215 Democrats voted for Jeffries on the first ballot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Did You Know?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Congress Is Making Huge Investments. <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/gov-trades/?utm_source=BZprocontent010325\"><strong>Get Tips On What They Bought And Sold Ahead Of The 2024 Election With Our Easy-to-Use Tool</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It's Important: </strong>Johnson's win comes after <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42757258/trump-advocates-for-mike-johnsons-speakership\">he recently received</a> President-elect <strong>Donald Trump's </strong>support for the speaker role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elon Musk</strong>, who previously criticized Johnson's handling of the spending bill, showed <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1874640771208691832\">support </a>on Jan. 1 for Johnson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last-minute changing of votes by two of the three holdouts led to only one round of voting being needed. Further rounds of voting could have seen more Congress members choose to not support Johnson as he faced more than three question marks among members heading into Friday's vote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A division among Republican members of Congress could have been a bad look for the political party, which now has control of both chambers of Congress and the White House. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it looked like Johnson wouldn't secure the win, Jeffries took to X comment on the party:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The GOP Civil War is in full swing. And it's only Day 1,\" Jeffries <a href=\"https://x.com/RepJeffries/status/1875247988899209559\">tweeted</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A tweet from former Rep. <strong>Matt Gaetz </strong><a href=\"https://x.com/mattgaetz/status/1875191893140918545\">saying </a>Johnson would be elected speaker Friday on the first vote received a Community Note before the official results of the first ballot were completed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Massie <a href=\"https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1875264260252783025\">commented </a>on the tweet \"this one didn't age well\" before later replying again that \"actually looks like mine didn't age well.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On prediction markets like <strong>Polymarket </strong>and <strong>Kalshi</strong>, Johnson's odds for speaker re-election were above 90% prior to the spending bill and near government shutdown items in December where his odds dropped to less than 67% on each platform, as Benzinga previously reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/economics/macro-economic-events/25/01/42783501/us-house-speaker-vote-could-derail-market-friendly-legislation-experts-warn-cast-into-doubt-whether-congress-can-achieve-anything-market-friendly\"><strong>US House Speaker Vote Could Derail Market-Friendly Legislation, Experts Warn: &#8216;Cast Into Doubt&#8230;Whether Congress Can Achieve Anything Market-Friendly&#8217;</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Shutterstock</em></p>"

        "summary": " ",
        "content": "<p>Cryptocurrency is already redefining how we spend money. Increasingly, people are moving away from traditional financial services and their providers to the convenience and decentralized systems that cryptocurrencies provide. The emergence of innovations such as crypto loans, crypto savings accounts, and Bitcoin wallets has spiked conversations about the transformative potential of cryptocurrency-based financial tools within exchanges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent developments in the global crypto landscape, including a push for friendlier regulatory frameworks, the increasing financial influence of GenZ, and improved access to crypto loans, are accelerating the transition toward a more integrated financial ecosystem. With more regulatory clarity and growing adoption, cryptocurrency exchanges' involvement in this evolution is inevitable. This suggests that by 2027, many digital asset platforms could become full-fledged financial institutions, providing services like interest-earning accounts, crypto-collateralized loans, and seamless payment solutions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Increasingly Streamlined Crypto Regulations&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the major regulatory milestones for the crypto market in 2024 was the approval of <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/spot-bitcoin-etfs-are-approved-by-sec-cleared-to-start-trading-thursday-8357670\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bitcoin spot ETFs</a> by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January. This was followed in July by the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, allowing people to trade the two largest cryptocurrencies as financial instruments in the traditional financial world.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Donald Trump's election win and subsequent pro-crypto statements, along with initiatives offered by the new presidential administration, significantly influenced crypto regulations in late 2024.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the most transformative changes are expected to take place around 2026-2027, as multiple countries align their strategies for taxing cryptocurrency transactions. <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/11/g20_declaration_tech_initiatives/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">G20 sets 2027 as the year</a> in which its members can tax crypto transactions. Globally, 48 countries have committed to adopting <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/11/10/international-deal-to-combat-crypto-tax-evasion-to-start-2027-as-48-countries-sign-up&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1733436753554134&amp;usg=AOvVaw015S18_F6jLotHdSu02pLH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a tax transparency standard</a> by 2027, introducing the automatic exchange of information between jurisdictions to combat tax evasion on cryptocurrency platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other countries like the UK already have plans for their <a href=\"https://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com/notes/fsrandcorpcrime/2024-posts/crypto-roadmap-crypto-regulatory-regime-live-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">crypto regulation regime</a> to go live in 2026, establishing clearer rules for digital assets and crypto exchange operations. Similarly, <a href=\"https://dig.watch/updates/south-korea-postpones-crypto-tax-to-2027\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">South Korea</a> is preparing to implement crypto taxation policies by 2027.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simultaneously, traditional financial institutions will likelo deepen their involvement in the crypto sector. Beginning in January 2026, banks will be required to disclose their exposure to digital assets, signaling a closer integration of traditional finance and cryptocurrencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Banking the Unbanked&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the various developments in traditional finance, financial inclusion is still a mirage due to the many limitations the average person experiences. For instance, banks are centralized and they have rigorous processes that make them favorable to some than others. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/deposits/checking/explore-advantage-banking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bank of America</a> has a minimum opening deposit of up to $100, depending on the type of account you choose. Other banks may charge various fees, including transaction fees of up to 3%, monthly maintenance fees, and wire transfer charges that eat deep into people's savings.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, not everyone still gets access to these financial services, as many banks, including JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo, still primarily operate in urban or metropolitan areas and have limited remote service options. According to the World Bank, <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/financialinclusion/overview#:~:text=Great%20strides%20have%20been%20made,adult%20population%20had%20an%20account.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1.4 billion people</a> (17% of the global population) had no bank accounts as of 2021. That's where cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance as instruments for inclusive financing methods come in.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Decentralized Loan and Investment Services&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional banks and lenders offer various loan products. However,\u00a0 it's almost impossible to access loans in some countries because of their strict paperwork, bureaucracy, and record-high interest rates. For instance, Zimbabwe and Argentina <a href=\"https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/lending_interest_rate/#:~:text=Lending%20interest%20rate%20%2D%20Country%20rankings&amp;text=The%20average%20for%202023%20based,countries%20where%20data%20are%20available.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">have a lending interest rate</a> of 170.29% and 97% respectively, making loans impossible for individuals and businesses in the country. The average lending rate offered by banks in 2023 based on 83 countries was <a href=\"https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/lending_interest_rate/#:~:text=Lending%20interest%20rate%20%2D%20Country%20rankings&amp;text=The%20average%20for%202023%20based%20on%2083%20countries%20was%2014.19%20percent.\">14.19%</a>, while the general average lending rate across all tokens and crypto platforms is approximately <a href=\"https://defirate.com/lend/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">6.06%</a>. \u200b\u200b</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, decentralized protocols and platforms offer crypto loans and investment services like yield farming and crypto lending to users. These DeFi features are similar to what's obtainable in traditional banking, allowing customers to get collateralized crypto loans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, these <a href=\"https://www.figuremarkets.com/resources/insights/everything-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-loans/#:~:text=Unlike%20traditional%20loans%20that%20typically,itself%20reduces%20the%20lender's%20risk.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">decentralized crypto loans</a> are more convenient to get. They require no paperwork or credit score checks. They are also disbursed instantly, making them more accessible. For instance, the average loan approval rate on DeFi protocols is nearly 100% if the demands are met. Conversely, <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/754738/small-businesses-loan-approval-rates-usa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">big banks</a> only approved about 13% of loans for small businesses in 2023.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Expanding Role of Crypto in Payment Systems</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Businesses are increasingly integrating crypto payments into web platforms to introduce secure, cost-efficient transactions. The Crypto Payment Gateways Market, valued at $1.2 billion in 2023, is <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cryptocurrency-payment-apps-market-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">projected</a> to grow at a CAGR of over 15% from 2024 to 2032.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A notable development occurred in May 2024, when Coinbase Commerce partnered with Crypto.com Pay to launch a web-based crypto payment gateway for e-commerce, gaming, and financial services. This system increases transaction efficiency, converts crypto to fiat seamlessly, and reduces operational complexity, reflecting the broader adoption of cryptocurrency in daily operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McKenzie <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/global-payments-in-2024-simpler-interfaces-complex-reality\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">analysts</a> predict annual revenue growth in the crypto payments sector of about 10.3%, with the global digital payments market itself growing at 25% annually through 2027. By then, cryptocurrencies will likely to account for a meaningful portion of alternative payment methods globally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With an increasing role of crypto wallets and exchanges in handling such transactions, 2027 will see direct support for digital asset platforms to act as second banks to users, making it possible to receive funds directly, send them across different banks, and operate within a synchronized hybrid banking system.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Gen Z Influence</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The existing banking structure revolutionized wealth management for Baby Boomers (people between 60 and 78 years old). However, Millennials and Gen Z adults consider these banking structures obsolete, expensive, and slow. As a result, the new generation seeks banks and crypto brokerages that are less clunky and opaque.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dlnews.com/articles/snapshot/younger-generations-prefer-on-chain-to-online-finances/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Reports</a> from Coinbase reveal that 55% of GenZ adults prefer to move their funds on-chain instead of using digital banking platforms. Similarly, a<a href=\"https://www.bitget.site/blog/articles/bitget-study-reveals-millennials-and-gen-z-tend-to-build-a-more-crypto-favorable-society\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Bitget survey</a> conducted between January 2022 and January 2023 found that 21% of the GenZ group are active crypto holders. This trend is driven by the group's inclination toward modern technologies like blockchain and digital assets, coupled with their lack of exposure to the financial crisis as they were born after the 2008 economic meltdown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://tink.com/blog/news/2024-consumer-banking-insights/\">a survey</a> by Tink, 31% of Gen Z said their bank was at risk of losing them as a customer if digital tools and services weren't upgraded. That's why they boast a higher number of crypto wallets than their older counterparts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The future of finance is already being shaped by GenZ users who by 2025 <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/05/gen-z-don-t-want-to-work-for-you-here-s-how-to-change-their-mind/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">are expected to </a>make up over 25% of the workforce. Their preferences for digital financial alternatives are driving increased competition between traditional banks and cryptocurrency exchanges, compelling both sectors to introduce hybrid solutions that blend traditional and digital finance elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Future and Banking Functionality&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking beyond 2025, one of the biggest anticipations is the expansion of cryptocurrency exchanges to support better financial inclusion in the future. Currently, crypto exchanges have already incorporated elements of traditional finance into their services such as crypto savings accounts, crypto credit cards, and loans. Many of them are on the rise as they give users increased accessibility and flexibility.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These services operate similarly to what you'll find in the conventional world, showing the massive potential within the crypto industry. With clearer regulatory frameworks and better support for cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrency exchanges will have more freedom to create new use cases for digital assets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, we could see more hybrid financial structures with exchanges providing a mix of crypto-based or fiat-related services. These will create room for stablecoins and tokenized assets to act as alternatives to fiat money. They can be used for collateralized loans, competitive interest-earning accounts, and other everyday banking functions. Additionally, cross-border payment solutions offered by cryptocurrency exchanges would make transactions instant and low-cost, reducing remittance fees to under 1%, compared to the traditional average of 6.3%. By addressing these pain points, centralized exchanges could reshape public perception, positioning themselves as efficient and cost-effective solutions in the financial ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can already see cryptocurrency exchanges obtaining bank charters in certain regions, showing the future of the union between exchanges and traditional banking. As these possibilities shape up, one thing is clear \u2014 the future of cryptocurrency and digital asset exchanges will take a big leap following regulatory support and other potential reforms in the industry.\u00a0</p>"

The proprietary protection band from The Arora Report is very popular.&nbsp; The protection band puts all of the data, all of the indicators, all of the news, all of the crosscurrents, all of the models, and all of the analysis in an analytical framework that is easily actionable by investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.&nbsp; The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.&nbsp; If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash.&nbsp; A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.&nbsp; </strong>When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp; High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Traditional 60/40 Portfolio</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.&nbsp; Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

But let's not forget that while watching smart money flow can provide valuable insights, it is crucial to incorporate effective risk management strategies to protect capital and mitigate potential losses.

        "summary": "The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals officially pulled the plug on net neutrality.",
        "content": "<p>The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals officially pulled the plug <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/government/regulations/25/01/42779998/6th-circuit-strikes-down-fcc-net-neutrality-rules-in-blow-to-biden-administrations-internet-regulation-agenda\">on net neutrality</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: On Jan. 2, the court ruled that the Federal Communications Commission lacks legal authority to reclassify broadband as a \"telecommunications service\" under Title II of the Communications Act. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, a three-judge panel of the Cincinnati-based Sixth Circuit declared that broadband is an &#8220;information service.&#8221; This distinction matters because \"information services\" are subject to lighter regulatory oversight.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The court essentially overturned rules first established under the Obama administration in 2015, which prohibited ISPs from throttling speeds, blocking access, or prioritizing certain websites or services for a fee. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The first Trump administration repealed those rules in 2017. The FCC voted last April to reinstate net neutrality by reclassifying broadband. The attempt received a decisive burial under the new ruling, marking a major defeat for the outgoing Biden administration.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/etfs/sector-etfs/25/01/42795070/global-ev-sales-poised-to-grow-in-2025-3-etfs-in-focus\">Global EV Sales Poised To Grow In 2025 \u2014 3 ETFs In Focus</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The decision could reshape how Americans access and pay for the internet. It also gives internet service providers a victory lap while potentially stranding consumers and tech giants in the slow lane.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>FCC Chair <strong>Jessica Rosenworcel</strong>, a staunch supporter of net neutrality, is urging Congress to step in and legislate an open internet.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&#8220;Consumers across the country have told us again and again that they want an internet that is fast, open and fair. With this decision it is clear that Congress now needs to heed their call, take up the charge for net neutrality and put open internet principles in federal law,&#8221; she said. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, incoming FCC chair <strong>Brendan Carr</strong>, who voted against net neutrality's reinstatement in 2024, welcomed the court&#8217;s decision. He called Biden's attempt to restore the rules an \"internet power grab.\"</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\"President Biden's entire plan rested on the Chicken Little tactic of persuading Americans that the Internet would break in the absence of these so-called \u2018net neutrality' regulations,\" Carr said in a <a href=\"https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-408580A1.pdf\">statement</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Former FCC chair <strong>Ajit Pai </strong>also praised the court's decision, urging a focus on expanding internet access rather than resurrecting net neutrality.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Big Telecom Is Smiling</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The ruling is a victory for ISPs like <strong>Comcast</strong> <strong>Corp.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/CMCSA#NASDAQ\">CMCSA</a>), <strong>Verizon Inc.</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/VZ#NYSE\">VZ</a>), and <strong>AT&amp;T Inc.</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/T#NYSE\">T</a>), which now enjoy greater freedom to manage their networks without regulatory constraints. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>These companies can explore tiered pricing models, prioritize certain types of traffic, and charge content providers for faster delivery.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For years, ISPs have argued that deregulation spurs innovation and investment. Industry group USTelecom, which represents major ISPs, hailed the court's decision as a win for \"American consumers,\" promising it would lead to more competition, investment, and faster internet services, especially in rural and underserved areas.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Equipment Makers Could Cash In</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Network infrastructure providers like <strong>Cisco Systems Inc.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/CSCO#NASDAQ\">CSCO</a>), <strong>Ericsson</strong> (NASDAQ: , and <strong>Nokia</strong> <strong>Corp.</strong> (NYSE: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/nok#NYSE\">NOK</a>) stand to benefit as ISPs ramp up capital expenditures to upgrade and expand their networks. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If ISPs follow through on promises to improve infrastructure, these firms could see heightened demand for their routers, switches, and fiber technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who Loses? Consumers</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For everyday internet users, the implications of this decision are murky and potentially grim. While ISPs argue that deregulation will lead to better services, consumers might find themselves paying more for the same internet access.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Critics warn that the decision could limit competition, as ISPs consolidate power and consumer choice shrinks. Advocacy groups like Free Press have raised concerns that this ruling will create an uneven internet, where access and quality depend on your ability to pay.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Past net neutrality violations include: </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Comcast allegedly <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/11/17438638/net-neutrality-violation-history-restoring-internet-freedom-order?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">throttling</a> users&#8217; internet speeds in 2007.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>AT&amp;T <a href=\"https://www.freepress.net/sites/default/files/legacy-policy/att-factsheet-fp.pdf\">restricting</a> the use of Apple&#8217;s FaceTime application over its cellular network and limiting it to customers on specific data plans in 2012.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Verizon <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/debug/net-neutrality-violations-history/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">blocking</a> text messages from NARAL Pro-Choice America, a pro-choice organization, in 2007.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Sprint, Verizon, and AT&amp;T favoring access to their own mobile payment solutions over <strong>Alphabet Inc.</strong>&#8216;s<strong> </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOGL#NASDAQ\">GOOGL</a>) Google Wallet.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The absence of net neutrality could mean headaches for companies like Alphabet, <strong>Amazon.com Inc.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ\">AMZN</a>), <strong>Meta Platforms Inc</strong>. (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/META#NASDAQ\">META</a>), and <strong>Netflix</strong> <strong>Inc.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NFLX#NASDAQ\">NFLX</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>These content providers may now be forced to pay ISPs for \"fast lane\" access to ensure their services run smoothly. While giants like Netflix and Alphabet can absorb the costs or negotiate favorable deals, smaller content providers may not be so lucky.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Startups, Small Businesses Lose Equal Footing</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Startups that rely on equal access to the internet are likely to suffer the most. In a world without net neutrality, deep-pocketed tech firms can afford to pay for speed advantages, but startups and small businesses could face slower connections and higher costs, limiting their ability to compete.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/25/01/42792034/biden-blocks-us-steel-deal-whats-next-for-x-stock\">Biden Blocks US Steel Deal: What&#8217;s Next For X Stock?</a></strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p> "

        "content": "<p>A New York judge on Friday upheld President-elect <strong>Donald Trump</strong>'s criminal conviction while hinting at leniency in sentencing, a significant twist in a <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/topic/donald-trump\">high-profile legal battle. </a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judge <strong>Juan M. Merchan</strong> indicated he would likely issue an unconditional discharge, a rare outcome that avoids jail time or probation and allows Trump to pursue appellate options, The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/nyregion/trump-sentencing-hush-money-case-ny.html?campaign_id=190&amp;emc=edit_ufn_20250103&amp;instance_id=143819&amp;nl=from-the-times&#xAE;i_id=136109156&amp;segment_id=187269&amp;user_id=e415429009fa21c5b8b4141c24d72bca\">reports</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Merchan, in an 18-page decision, ruled against overturning the Manhattan jury's May conviction of Trump on 34 counts of falsifying business records. The charges stemmed from allegations that Trump orchestrated hush money payments during his 2016 campaign to suppress a sex scandal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Merchan also rejected Trump's claims that his conviction violated presidential immunity or should be dismissed in light of his recent election victory, the New York Times reports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sentencing, scheduled for Jan. 10, ensures Trump's felony status will stand as he takes the oath of office later this month. Prosecutors had pushed for accountability, while the defense argued that any punishment would disrupt Trump's ability to govern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42779917/trump-wont-announce-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-via-executive-order-says-analyst-he-would-likely-buy-btc-in-the-background\">Trump Won&#8217;t Announce Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Via Executive Order, Says Analyst: &#8216;He Would Likely Buy BTC In The Background&#8217;</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump's impending sentencing solidifies his position as the first U.S. president to assume office with a felony conviction. Merchan's decision highlights the judiciary's role in balancing presidential immunity concerns against the principle of equal accountability under the law. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump's legal team could still pursue an appeal to delay sentencing, further entwining legal and political challenges as his presidency begins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding broader implications, concerns over Trump's economic strategies \u2014 termed \"Maganomics\" \u2014 have resurfaced. Economists have raised fears of inflationary policies and long-term instability, despite short-term growth projections.

He underscored that while everything on the planet is better now than 50 years ago, there's one exception.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Speaking at the New York Times&#8217; DealBook Summit, Bezos shared his perspective on the state of the planet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bezos emphasized that while significant progress has been made in reducing infant mortality, increasing global literacy, and lowering poverty rates, the environment continues to suffer. He highlighted the ongoing pollution and depletion affecting oceans, rivers, and forests over the past 500 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon&#8217;s environmental footprint was also noted. In 2022, the company emitted 70.74 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, which accounts for approximately 1.1% of total U.S. emissions. Despite this, Amazon is committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"When people talk about the good old days, that's such an illusion. Almost everything is better today than it was&#8230;with one exception, which is the natural world.\" Jeff Bezos said during the summit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bezos is investing in his aerospace venture, <strong>Blue Origin</strong>, to explore solutions for Earth&#8217;s resource challenges. He envisions utilizing space resources to provide &#8220;infinite energy, infinite raw materials.&#8221; Blue Origin has completed nine human spaceflights, with the latest in November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: </strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/12/42737402/bernie-sanders-supports-trumps-credit-card-interest-rate-cap-at-10-amid-highest-defaults-since-2008-visa-and-mastercard-trade-in-the-red?itm_source=parsely-api\"><strong>Bernie Sanders Calls Trump&#8217;s 10% Interest Rate Cap On Credit Card Debt A &#8216;Great Idea&#8217; As Defaults Surge</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bezos&#8217; vision for space exploration is centered on preserving Earth, contrasting with <strong>Elon Musk</strong>&#8216;s SpaceX mission to make humanity multiplanetary.

Intel Corp</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/INTC#NASDAQ\">INTC</a>): Not in Top 20</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It's Important: </strong>Nvidia takes the crown as the most-searched ticker on Benzinga Pro in 2024, which comes as the stock often ranked in the top three on a monthly basis. With a gain of over 170% in 2024, Nvidia was one of the top performing S&amp;P 500 stocks. Nvidia also briefly became the most valuable company in the world multiple times in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla ranked second for searches, which isn't a huge surprise given the company's loyal fan base and the stock ranking among the top three most months, including multiple months in first month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust, which is the largest ETF, ranked third for the year, which comes after the ETF ranked second in the first half of 2024 and was passed by Tesla to end the year. The ETF has often been a top performer on Benzinga Pro searches over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super Micro Computer ranked fourth for the year as it was one of the most widely followed stories of a soaring stock that later attracted short reports and concerns for fraud and accounting irregularities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple ranked fifth, but the stock could move down the list in 2025 if trends hold. Apple was ranked outside of the top 20 in the month of December, which is rather unusual for the world's most valuable company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Palantir rose in the second half of 2024 for Benzinga Pro searches going from 10<sup>th</sup> in the first half of the year to end the year ranked seventh. A huge gain in the company's share price likely contributed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another top storyline in 2024 was the return of <strong>Roaring Kitty, </strong>aka <strong>Keith Gill</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/education/24/05/38793704/who-is-roaring-kitty-why-does-his-return-to-social-media-matter-for-gamestop-stock\">to social media</a>, which sent shares of GameStop soaring in several months of 2024. The stock ranked seventh for searches in the first half. While the stock has not been as popular in the later months of 2024, GameStop ended the year as the 10<sup>th</sup> most-searched ticker and shares were up 88%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A soaring price of <strong>Bitcoin </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/btc/usd\">BTC</a>) in 2024 helped lead to several crypto related stocks soar in interest in the later half of 2024 and overall on the year. Bitcoin hit new all-time highs after <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/11/41778425/bitcoins-all-time-high-a-groundbreaking-milestone-and-strong-post-election-rally-coming-ex\">the 2024 election </a>and hit the $100,000 milestone in December 2024. MARA Holdings, Coinbase and MicroStrategy all ranked among the top 20 searched tickers for the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump Media &amp; Technology, which is a media company co-founded by President-elect <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, ranked 13<sup>th</sup> on the year. The stock saw a surge in price and huge interest as the 2024 election neared before shares fell and interest minimized after his win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the 2024 year saw nine of the top 10 most-searched tickers in the first six months of 2024 remain the most-searched tickers for the year with Amazon.com moving into the top 10 and MARA moving down to 12<sup>th</sup> place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the top 20 most-searched tickers for the full year, 16 were among the 20 most-searched tickers for the first half of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/politics/24/10/41584466/these-10-stocks-were-the-best-s-p-500-performers-in-2017-when-trump-was-president-will-history-r\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">These 10 Stocks Were The Best S&amp;P 500 Performers In 2017 When Trump Was President: Will History Repeat Itself?</a></strong></li>\n</ul>    "
